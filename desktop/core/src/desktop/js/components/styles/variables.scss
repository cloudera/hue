// THESE VARIABLES ARE FOR REACT.JS COMPONENTS
// (and possibly some Vue components until they have been translated to react)

// Many, but not all, cuix can be imported from the cuix-core library.
// These variable are prefixed with fluidx which is the legacy name of cuix.
// Includes both spacing and color variables.
@import '@cloudera/cuix-core/variables.scss';

// TODO: These variables are named diferently. We should remove the usage.
@import './colors';

// Some handy variables used by cuix are only available as less variables where the
// origin of the value can be either cuix or antd. Here we manually recreate the once we
// want in Hue as sass variables.
