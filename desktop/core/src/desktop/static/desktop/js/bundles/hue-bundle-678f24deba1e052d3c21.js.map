It supports\n * multiple any amount of nested children with foreachVisible bindings\n *\n * The minHeight parameter is the initial expected rendered height of each entry, once rendered the real\n * height is used. It keeps a number of elements above and below the visible elements to make slow scrolling\n * smooth.\n *\n * The height of the container element has to be less than or equal to the inner height of the window.\n *\n * Example:\n *\n * <div class=\"container\" style=\"overflow-y: scroll; height: 100px\">\n *  <ul data-bind=\"foreachVisible: { data: items, minHeight: 20, container: '.container' }\">\n *    <li>...</li>\n *  </ul>\n * </div>\n *\n * For tables the binding has to be attached to the tbody element:\n *\n * <div class=\"container\" style=\"overflow-y: scroll; height: 100px\">\n *  <table>\n *    <thead>...</thead>\n *    <tbody data-bind=\"foreachVisible: { data: items, minHeight: 20, container: '.container' }>\n *      <tr>...</tr>\n *    </tbody>\n *  </ul>\n * </div>\n *\n * Currently the binding only supports one element inside the bound element otherwise the height\n * calculations will be off. In other words this will make it go bonkers:\n *\n * <div class=\"container\" style=\"overflow-y: scroll; height: 100px\">\n *  <ul data-bind=\"foreachVisible: { data: items, minHeight: 20, container: '.container' }\">\n *    <li>...</li>\n *    <li style=\"display: none;\">...</li>\n *  </ul>\n * </div>\n *\n */\nko.bindingHandlers.foreachVisible = {\n  init: function(element, valueAccessor, allBindings, viewModel, bindingContext) {\n    return ko.bindingHandlers.template.init(\n      element,\n      () => {\n        return {\n          foreach: [],\n          templateEngine: ko.nativeTemplateEngine.instance\n        };\n      },\n      allBindings,\n      viewModel,\n      bindingContext\n    );\n  },\n\n  update: function(element, valueAccessor, allBindings, viewModel, bindingContext) {\n    const options = valueAccessor();\n    let $element = $(element);\n    let isTable = false;\n\n    if ($element.parent().is('table')) {\n      $element = $element.parent();\n      isTable = true;\n    }\n\n    const $container = $element.closest(options.container);\n\n    const id = Math.random();\n\n    // This is possibly a parent element that has the foreachVisible binding\n    const $parentFVElement = bindingContext.$parentForeachVisible || null;\n    const parentId = bindingContext.$parentForeachVisibleId || -1;\n    // This is the element from the parent foreachVisible rendered element that contains\n    // this one or container for root\n    let $parentFVOwnerElement = $container;\n    $element.data('parentForeachVisible', $parentFVElement);\n\n    const depth = bindingContext.$depth || 0;\n\n    // Locate the owning element if within another foreach visible binding\n    if ($parentFVElement) {\n      const myOffset = $element.offset().top;\n      $parentFVElement.children().each((idx, child) => {\n        const $child = $(child);\n        if (myOffset > $child.offset().top) {\n          $parentFVOwnerElement = $child;\n        } else {\n          return false;\n        }\n      });\n    }\n\n    if ($parentFVOwnerElement.data('disposalFunction')) {\n      $parentFVOwnerElement.data('disposalFunction')();\n      $parentFVOwnerElement.data('lastKnownHeights', null);\n    }\n\n    let entryMinHeight = options.minHeight;\n    const allEntries = ko.utils.unwrapObservable(options.data);\n\n    let visibleEntryCount = 0;\n    let incrementLimit = 0; // The diff required to re-render, set to visibleCount below\n    let elementIncrement = 0; // Elements to add on either side of the visible elements, set to 3x visibleCount\n\n    const updateVisibleEntryCount = function() {\n      // TODO: Drop the window innerHeight limitation.\n      // Sometimes after resizeWrapper() is called the reported innerHeight of the $container is the same as\n      // the wrapper causing the binding to render all the items.
