In most cases, end users will not need to use this additional tag, except when doing a manual bootstrap of a replication-destination warehouse so that an incremental replication tool can take over from that point.            </p>\n                <p>\n    They make use of a special table property called \"repl.last.id\" in a table or partition (depending on what object is being replicated) object to make sure that a replication export/import will only update objects if the update is newer than the object it affects. On the export end, it tags the replication export dump with an id that is monotonically increasing on the source warehouse (incrementing each time there is a source warehouse metastore modification). In addition, an export that is tagged as being for replication will not result in an error if it attempts to export an object which does not currently exist. (This is because in the general flow of replication, it is quite possible that by the time an event is acted upon for replication by an external tool, it is possible that the object has been removed, and thus, should not halt the replication pipeline.)            </p>\n                <p>\n    On the import side, there is no syntax change, but import is run on an export dump that was generated with the FOR REPLICATION tag, it will check the object it is replicating into if it exists. If that object already exists, it checks the repl.last.id property of that object to determine if what is being imported is newer than the current state of the object in the destination warehouse. If the update is newer, then it replaces the object with the newer information. If the update is older than the object already in place, the update is ignored, and causes no error.            </p>\n                <p>\n    For those using EXPORT for the first-time manual bootstrapping usecase, users are recommended to use a \" FOR replication('bootstrapping') \" tag. (Advanced users note : The choice of \"bootstrapping\" here is arbitrary-ish, and could just as well have been \"foo\". The real goal is to have a value such that all further incremental replication ids will be greater than this original id. Thus, the integral value of this initial id should be 0, and thus, any string which does not contain numbers is acceptable. Having an initial tag be \"123456\", however, would be bad, as it could cause further updates which have a repl.last.id &lt; 123456 to not be applied.)            </p>\n        </div>\n    <div id=\"src-27837968_LanguageManualImportExport-Examples\">\n        <h2><span>Examples</span></h2>\n            <p>\n    Simple export and import:            </p>\n        <div>\n                <div>\n        <pre><code>export table department to 'hdfs_exports_location/department';\nimport from 'hdfs_exports_location/department';</code></pre>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n            <p>\n    Rename table on import:            </p>\n        <div>\n                <div>\n        <pre><code>export table department to 'hdfs_exports_location/department';\nimport table imported_dept from 'hdfs_exports_location/department';</code></pre>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n            <p>\n    Export partition and import:            </p>\n        <div>\n                <div>\n        <pre><code>export table employee partition (emp_country=\"in\", emp_state=\"ka\") to 'hdfs_exports_location/employee';\nimport from 'hdfs_exports_location/employee';</code></pre>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n            <p>\n    Export table and import partition:            </p>\n        <div>\n                <div>\n        <pre><code>export table employee to 'hdfs_exports_location/employee';\nimport table employee partition (emp_country=\"us\", emp_state=\"tn\") from 'hdfs_exports_location/employee';</code></pre>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n            <p>\n    Specify the import location:            </p>\n        <div>\n                <div>\n        <pre><code>export table department to 'hdfs_exports_location/department';\nimport table department from 'hdfs_exports_location/department' \n       location 'import_target_location/department';</code></pre>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n            <p>\n    Import as an external table:            </p>\n        <div>\n                <div>\n        <pre><code>export table department to 'hdfs_exports_location/department';\nimport external table department from 'hdfs_exports_location/department';</code></pre>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    </div>\n        </div>\n    </div></div>","title":"ImportExport"}
