For example, this query:            </p>\n        <div style=\"counter-reset: scroll-code-numbering 1\">\n                <div class=\"hue-doc-codeblock\">  SELECT a.val, b.val FROM a LEFT OUTER JOIN b ON (a.key=b.key)\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <p>\n    will return a row for every row in a. This output row will be a.val,b.val when there is a b.key that equals a.key, and the output row will be a.val,NULL when there is no corresponding b.key. Rows from b which have no corresponding a.key will be dropped. The syntax \"FROM a LEFT OUTER JOIN b\" must be written on one line in order to understand how it works--a is to the LEFT of b in this query, and so all rows from a are kept; a RIGHT OUTER JOIN will keep all rows from b, and a FULL OUTER JOIN will keep all rows from a and all rows from b. OUTER JOIN semantics should conform to standard SQL specs.            </p>\n    </li></ul><ul><li>            <p>\n    Joins occur BEFORE WHERE CLAUSES. So, if you want to restrict the OUTPUT of a join, a requirement should be in the WHERE clause, otherwise it should be in the JOIN clause. A big point of confusion for this issue is partitioned tables:            </p>\n        <div style=\"counter-reset: scroll-code-numbering 1\">\n                <div class=\"hue-doc-codeblock\">  SELECT a.val, b.val FROM a LEFT OUTER JOIN b ON (a.key=b.key)\n  WHERE a.ds='2009-07-07' AND b.ds='2009-07-07'\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <p>\n    will join a on b, producing a list of a.val and b.val. The WHERE clause, however, can also reference other columns of a and b that are in the output of the join, and then filter them out. However, whenever a row from the JOIN has found a key for a and no key for b, all of the columns of b will be NULL, <strong>including the ds column</strong>. This is to say, you will filter out all rows of join output for which there was no valid b.key, and thus you have outsmarted your LEFT OUTER requirement. In other words, the LEFT OUTER part of the join is irrelevant if you reference any column of b in the WHERE clause. Instead, when OUTER JOINing, use this syntax:            </p>\n        <div style=\"counter-reset: scroll-code-numbering 1\">\n                <div class=\"hue-doc-codeblock\">  SELECT a.val, b.val FROM a LEFT OUTER JOIN b\n  ON (a.key=b.key AND b.ds='2009-07-07' AND a.ds='2009-07-07')\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <p>\n    ..the result is that the output of the join is pre-filtered, and you won't get post-filtering trouble for rows that have a valid a.key but no matching b.key. The same logic applies to RIGHT and FULL joins.            </p>\n    </li></ul><ul><li>            <p>\n    Joins are NOT commutative! Joins are left-associative regardless of whether they are LEFT or RIGHT joins.            </p>\n        <div style=\"counter-reset: scroll-code-numbering 1\">\n                <div class=\"hue-doc-codeblock\">  SELECT a.val1, a.val2, b.val, c.val\n  FROM a\n  JOIN b ON (a.key = b.key)\n  LEFT OUTER JOIN c ON (a.key = c.key)\n</div>\n    </div>\n            <p>\n    ...first joins a on b, throwing away everything in a or b that does not have a corresponding key in the other table. The reduced table is then joined on c. This provides unintuitive results if there is a key that exists in both a and c but not b: The whole row (including a.val1, a.val2, and a.key) is dropped in the \"a JOIN b\" step because it is not in b. The result does not have a.key in it, so when it is LEFT OUTER JOINed with c, c.val does not make it in because there is no c.key that matches an a.key (because that row from a was removed). Similarly, if this were a RIGHT OUTER JOIN (instead of LEFT), we would end up with an even weirder effect: NULL, NULL, NULL, c.val, because even though we specified a.key=c.key as the join key, we dropped all rows of a that did not match the first JOIN.<br>To achieve the more intuitive effect, we should instead do FROM c LEFT OUTER JOIN a ON (c.key = a.key) LEFT OUTER JOIN b ON (c.key = b.key).            </p>\n    </li></ul><ul><li>            <p>\n    LEFT SEMI JOIN implements the uncorrelated IN/EXISTS subquery semantics in an efficient way.
