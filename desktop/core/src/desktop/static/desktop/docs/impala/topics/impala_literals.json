For Big Data\n        processing, the precise semantics of <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">NULL</span> values are significant: any misunderstanding\n        could lead to inaccurate results or misformatted data, that could be time-consuming to correct for large\n        data sets.\n      </p><ul><li><span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">NULL</span> is a different value than an empty string.

When these values are returned in a query, the result is <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">NULL</span>\n          whether the value was originally <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">NULL</span> or an empty string. This behavior is compatible\n          with the way Hive treats <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">NULL</span> values in partitioned tables. Hive does not allow empty\n          strings as partition keys, and it returns a string value such as\n          <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">__HIVE_DEFAULT_PARTITION__</span> instead of <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">NULL</span> when such values are\n          returned from a query. For example:\n<div class=\"hue-doc-codeblock\">create table t1 (i int) partitioned by (x int, y string);\n-- Select an INT column from another table, with all rows going into a special HDFS subdirectory\n-- named __HIVE_DEFAULT_PARTITION__.

ASC</span> queries, and at the beginning of the result set for <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">ORDER BY ...\n        DESC</span> queries. In effect, <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">NULL</span> is considered greater than all other values for\n        sorting purposes.
