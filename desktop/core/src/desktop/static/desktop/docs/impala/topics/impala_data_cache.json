{"body":"<div><div id=\"data_cache\"><div class=\"hue-doc-title\">Data Cache for Remote Reads</div><div><p>\n      When Impala compute nodes and its storage are not co-located, the network bandwidth\n      requirement goes up as the network traffic includes the data fetch as well as the\n      shuffling exchange traffic of intermediate results.\n    </p><p>\n      To mitigate the pressure on the network, you can enable the compute nodes to cache the\n      working set read from remote filesystems, such as, remote HDFS data node, S3, ABFS, ADLS.\n    </p><p>\n      To enable remote data cache, set the <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">--data_cache</span> Impala Daemon start-up\n      flag as below:\n    </p><div class=\"hue-doc-codeblock\">--data_cache=<span class=\"hue-doc-varname\">dir1</span>,<span class=\"hue-doc-varname\">dir2</span>,<span class=\"hue-doc-varname\">dir3</span>,...:<span class=\"hue-doc-varname\">quota</span></div><p>\n      The flag is set to a list of directories, separated by <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">,</span>, followed by a\n      <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">:</span>, and a capacity <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\"><span class=\"hue-doc-varname\">quota</span></span> per\n      directory.\n    </p><p>\n      If set to an empty string, data caching is disabled.\n    </p><p>\n      Cached data is stored in the specified directories.\n    </p><p>\n      The specified directories must exist in the local filesystem of each Impala Daemon, or\n      Impala will fail to start.\n    </p><p>\n      In addition, the filesystem which the directory resides in must support hole punching.\n    </p><p>\n      The cache can consume up to the <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">quota</span> bytes for each of the directories\n      specified.\n    </p><p>\n      The default setting for <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">--data_cache</span> is an empty string.\n    </p><p>\n      For example, with the following setting, the data cache may use up to 1 TB, with 500 GB\n      max in <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">/data/0</span> and <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">/data/1</span> respectively.\n    </p><div class=\"hue-doc-codeblock\">--data_cache=/data/0,/data/1:500GB</div><p> In Impala 3.4 and higher, you can configure one of the following cache eviction policies for\n      the data cache: <ul><li>LRU (Least Recently Used--the default)</li><li>LIRS (Inter-referenece Recency Set)</li></ul> LIRS is a scan-resistent, low performance-overhead policy.
