By default, Impala estimates the optimal size of the Bloom filter structure\n        regardless of the setting for this option.

Consider setting this query option immediately before the expensive query and\n      unsetting it immediately afterward.\n    </p><p id=\"kudu_blurb\"><b>Kudu considerations:</b></p><p id=\"filter_option_bloom_only\">\n        This query option affects only Bloom filters, not the min/max filters that are applied\n        to Kudu tables.
