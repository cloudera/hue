Even when SQL is working correctly, you might make further minor modifications for\n      best performance.\n    </p><p/></div><div><div class=\"hue-doc-title\">Porting DDL and DML Statements</div><div><p>\n        When adapting SQL code from a traditional database system to Impala, expect to find a number of differences\n        in the DDL statements that you use to set up the schema. Clauses related to physical layout of files,\n        tablespaces, and indexes have no equivalent in Impala. You might restructure your schema considerably to\n        account for the Impala partitioning scheme and Hadoop file formats.\n      </p><p>\n        Expect SQL queries to have a much higher degree of compatibility. With modest rewriting to address vendor\n        extensions and features not yet supported in Impala, you might be able to run identical or almost-identical\n        query text on both systems.\n      </p><p>\n        Therefore, consider separating out the DDL into a separate Impala-specific setup script.

In some cases, Impala supports join types but requires explicit syntax to\n            ensure you do not do inefficient joins of huge tables by accident. For example, Impala does not support\n            natural joins or anti-joins, and requires the <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">CROSS JOIN</span> operator for Cartesian\n            products. See <a class=\"hue-doc-internal-link\" href=\"javascript:void(0);\" data-doc-ref=\"topics/impala_joins.xml\" data-doc-anchor-id=\"joins\">Joins in Impala SELECT Statements</a> for details on the syntax for Impala join clauses.\n          </p></li><li><p>\n            Impala has a limited choice of partitioning types. Partitions are defined based on each distinct\n            combination of values for one or more partition key columns. Impala does not redistribute or check data\n            to create evenly distributed partitions; you must choose partition key columns based on your knowledge\n            of the data volume and distribution. Adapt any tables that use range, list, hash, or key partitioning\n            to use the Impala partition syntax for <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">CREATE TABLE</span> and <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">ALTER TABLE</span>\n            statements. Impala partitioning is similar to range partitioning where every range has exactly one\n            value, or key partitioning where the hash function produces a separate bucket for every combination of\n            key values.

Therefore, if each partition holds only a few megabytes of data, you are unlikely to see much\n            parallelism in the query because such a small amount of data is typically processed by a single node.\n          </div></li><li><p>\n            For <q>top-N</q> queries, Impala uses the <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">LIMIT</span> clause rather than comparing against a\n            pseudocolumn named <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">ROWNUM</span> or <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">ROW_NUM</span>.

Consider revising\n            your data load process to produce raw data files outside of Impala, then setting up Impala external\n            tables or using the <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">LOAD DATA</span> statement to use those data files instantly in Impala\n            tables, with no conversion or indexing stage.
