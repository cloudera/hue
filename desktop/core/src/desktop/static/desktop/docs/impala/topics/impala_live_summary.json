When the query finishes, the final\n        <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">SUMMARY</span> output remains visible in the\n        <span class=\"hue-doc-cmdname\">impala-shell</span> console output. </p><p>Starting in Impala 3.1, the summary output also\n      includes the queuing status consisting of whether the query was queued and\n      what was the latest queuing reason.</p><p><b>Type:</b><span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">Boolean</span></p><p><b>Default:</b><span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">FALSE (0)</span></p><p id=\"command_line_blurb\"><b>Command-line equivalent:</b></p><p> You can enable this query option within <span class=\"hue-doc-cmdname\">impala-shell</span>\n      by starting the shell with the <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">--live_summary</span>\n      command-line option. You can still turn this setting off and on again\n      within the shell through the <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">SET</span> command. </p><p id=\"usage_notes_blurb\"><b>Usage notes:</b></p><p> The live summary output can be useful for evaluating long-running\n      queries, to evaluate which phase of execution takes up the most time, or\n      if some hosts take much longer than others for certain operations,\n      dragging overall performance down. By making the information available in\n      real time, this feature lets you decide what action to take even before\n      you cancel a query that is taking much longer than normal. </p><p> For example, you might see the HDFS scan phase taking a long time, and\n      therefore revisit performance-related aspects of your schema design such\n      as constructing a partitioned table, switching to the Parquet file format,\n      running the <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">COMPUTE STATS</span> statement for the table, and so\n      on. Or you might see a wide variation between the average and maximum\n      times for all hosts to perform some phase of the query, and therefore\n      investigate if one particular host needed more memory or was experiencing\n      a network problem. </p><p id=\"live_reporting_details\">\n        The output from this query option is printed to standard\n        error. The output is  displayed only in interactive mode, not when the <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">-q</span>\n        or <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">-f</span> options are used. \n      </p><p> For a simple and concise way of tracking the progress of an interactive\n      query, see <a class=\"hue-doc-internal-link\" href=\"javascript:void(0);\" data-doc-ref=\"topics/impala_live_progress.xml\" data-doc-anchor-id=\"live_progress\">LIVE_PROGRESS Query Option (Impala 2.3 or higher only)</a>. </p><p id=\"restrictions_blurb\"><b>Restrictions:</b></p><p id=\"impala_shell_progress_reports_compute_stats_caveat\">\n        The <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">LIVE_PROGRESS</span> and <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">LIVE_SUMMARY</span> query options\n        currently do not produce any output during <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">COMPUTE STATS</span> operations.\n      </p><p id=\"impala_shell_progress_reports_shell_only_caveat\">\n        Because the <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">LIVE_PROGRESS</span> and <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">LIVE_SUMMARY</span> query\n        options are available only within the <span class=\"hue-doc-cmdname\">impala-shell</span> interpreter:\n        <ul><li><p>\n              You cannot change these query options through the SQL <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">SET</span>\n              statement using the JDBC or ODBC interfaces.
