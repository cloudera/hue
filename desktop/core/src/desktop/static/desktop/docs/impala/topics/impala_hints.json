With this hint, only one node writes to a\n            partition at a time, minimizing the global number of simultaneous writes and the\n            number of memory buffers holding data for individual partitions. This also reduces\n            fragmentation, resulting in fewer files. Thus it reduces overall resource usage of\n            the <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">INSERT</span> or <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">CTAS</span> operation and allows some\n            operations to succeed that otherwise would fail. It does involve some data transfer\n            between the nodes so that the data files for a particular partition are all written\n            on the same node.\n            <p>\n              Use <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">/* +SHUFFLE */</span> in cases where an <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">INSERT</span> or\n              <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">CTAS</span> statement fails or runs inefficiently due to all nodes\n              attempting to write data for all partitions.\n            </p><p>\n              If the table is unpartitioned or every partitioning expression is constant, then\n              <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">/* +SHUFFLE */</span> will cause every write to happen on the\n              coordinator node.\n            </p></li><li><span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">/* +NOSHUFFLE */</span> does not add exchange node before inserting to\n            partitioned tables and disables re-partitioning.

In this case, you\n            might need the <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">/* +SHUFFLE */</span> or the <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">/* +NOSHUFFLE\n            */</span> hint to override the execution plan selected by Impala.\n          </li></ul></li><li><span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">/* +CLUSTERED */</span> and <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">/* +NOCLUSTERED */</span> Hints\n        <ul><li><span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">/* +CLUSTERED */</span> sorts data by the partition columns before\n            inserting to ensure that only one partition is written at a time per node. Use this\n            hint to reduce the number of files kept open and the number of buffers kept in\n            memory simultaneously. This technique is primarily useful for inserts into Parquet\n            tables, where the large block size requires substantial memory to buffer data for\n            multiple output files at once.

Since Kudu partitions\n        and sorts rows on write, pre-partitioning and sorting takes some of the\n        load off of Kudu and helps large <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">INSERT</span> operations to\n        complete without timing out.

Once\n      Impala gained join order optimizations, sometimes join queries were automatically\n      reordered in a way that made a hint irrelevant. Therefore, the hints act more like\n      suggestions in Impala 1.2.2 and higher.\n    </p><p>\n      To force Impala to follow the hinted execution mechanism for a join query, include the\n      <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">STRAIGHT_JOIN</span> keyword in the <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">SELECT</span> statement. See\n      <a class=\"hue-doc-external-link\" href=\"https://www.cloudera.com/documentation/enterprise/latest/topics/impala_perf_joins.html#straight_join\" target=\"_blank\">Overriding Join Reordering with STRAIGHT_JOIN</a> for details. When you use this\n      technique, Impala does not reorder the joined tables at all, so you must be careful to\n      arrange the join order to put the largest table (or subquery result set) first, then the\n      smallest, second smallest, third smallest, and so on. This ordering lets Impala do the\n      most I/O-intensive parts of the query using local reads on the DataNodes, and then reduce\n      the size of the intermediate result set as much as possible as each subsequent table or\n      subquery result set is joined.\n    </p><p id=\"restrictions_blurb\"><b>Restrictions:</b></p><p>\n      Queries that include subqueries in the <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">WHERE</span> clause can be rewritten\n      internally as join queries. Currently, you cannot apply hints to the joins produced by\n      these types of queries.\n    </p><p>\n      Because hints can prevent queries from taking advantage of new metadata or improvements in\n      query planning, use them only when required to work around performance issues, and be\n      prepared to remove them when they are no longer required, such as after a new Impala\n      release or bug fix.\n    </p><p>\n      In particular, the <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">/* +BROADCAST */</span> and <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">/* +SHUFFLE */</span>\n      hints are expected to be needed much less frequently in Impala 1.2.2 and higher, because\n      the join order optimization feature in combination with the <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">COMPUTE STATS</span>\n      statement now automatically choose join order and join mechanism without the need to\n      rewrite the query and add hints. See <a class=\"hue-doc-external-link\" href=\"https://www.cloudera.com/documentation/enterprise/latest/topics/impala_perf_joins.html#perf_joins\" target=\"_blank\">Performance Considerations for Join Queries</a> for\n      details.\n    </p><p id=\"compatibility_blurb\"><b>Compatibility:</b></p><p>\n      The hints embedded within <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">--</span> comments are compatible with Hive queries.\n      The hints embedded within <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">/* */</span> comments or <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">[ ]</span> square\n      brackets are not recognized by or not compatible with Hive. For example, Hive raises an\n      error for Impala hints within <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">/* */</span> comments because it does not\n      recognize the Impala hint names.\n    </p><p id=\"view_blurb\"><b>Considerations for views:</b></p><p>\n      If you use a hint in the query that defines a view, the hint is preserved when you query\n      the view. Impala internally rewrites all hints in views to use the <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">--</span>\n      comment notation, so that Hive can query such views without errors due to unrecognized\n      hint names.\n    </p><p id=\"example_blurb\"><b>Examples:</b></p><p>\n      For example, this query joins a large customer table with a small lookup table of less\n      than 100 rows. The right-hand table can be broadcast efficiently to all nodes involved in\n      the join. Thus, you would use the <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">/* +broadcast */</span> hint to force a\n      broadcast join strategy:\n    </p><div class=\"hue-doc-codeblock\">select straight_join customer.address, state_lookup.state_name\n  from customer join <b>/* +broadcast */</b> state_lookup\n  on customer.state_id = state_lookup.state_id;</div><p>\n      This query joins two large tables of unpredictable size. You might benchmark the query\n      with both kinds of hints and find that it is more efficient to transmit portions of each\n      table to other nodes for processing. Thus, you would use the <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">/* +shuffle\n      */</span> hint to force a partitioned join strategy:\n    </p><div class=\"hue-doc-codeblock\">select straight_join weather.wind_velocity, geospatial.altitude\n  from weather join <b>/* +shuffle */</b> geospatial\n  on weather.lat = geospatial.lat and weather.long = geospatial.long;</div><p>\n      For joins involving three or more tables, the hint applies to the tables on either side of\n      that specific <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">JOIN</span> keyword. The <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">STRAIGHT_JOIN</span> keyword\n      ensures that joins are processed in a predictable order from left to right. For example,\n      this query joins <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">t1</span> and <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">t2</span> using a partitioned join,\n      then joins that result set to <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">t3</span> using a broadcast join:\n    </p><div class=\"hue-doc-codeblock\">select straight_join t1.name, t2.id, t3.price\n  from t1 join <b>/* +shuffle */</b> t2 join <b>/* +broadcast */</b> t3\n  on t1.id = t2.id and t2.id = t3.id;</div><p id=\"related_info\"><b>Related information:</b></p><p>\n      For more background information about join queries, see\n      <a class=\"hue-doc-internal-link\" href=\"javascript:void(0);\" data-doc-ref=\"topics/impala_joins.xml\" data-doc-anchor-id=\"joins\">Joins in Impala SELECT Statements</a>.
