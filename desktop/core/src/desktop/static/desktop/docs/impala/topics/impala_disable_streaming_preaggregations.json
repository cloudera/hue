{"body":"<div><div id=\"disable_streaming_preaggregations\"><div class=\"hue-doc-title\">DISABLE_STREAMING_PREAGGREGATIONS Query Option (Impala 2.5 or higher only)</div><div><p>\n      Turns off the <q>streaming preaggregation</q> optimization that is available in Impala 2.5\n      and higher. This optimization reduces unnecessary work performed by queries that perform aggregation\n      operations on columns with few or no duplicate values, for example <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">DISTINCT <span class=\"hue-doc-varname\">id_column</span></span>\n      or <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">GROUP BY <span class=\"hue-doc-varname\">unique_column</span></span>. If the optimization causes regressions in\n      existing queries that use aggregation functions, you can turn it off as needed by setting this query option.\n    </p><p id=\"type_boolean\"><b>Type:</b> Boolean; recognized values are 1 and 0, or <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">true</span> and\n        <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">false</span>; any other value interpreted as <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">false</span></p><p id=\"default_false_0\"><b>Default:</b><span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">false</span> (shown as 0 in output of <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">SET</span>\n        statement)\n      </p><div class=\"hue-doc-note\" id=\"one_but_not_true\">        In Impala 2.5.0, only the value 1 enables the option, and the value\n        <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">true</span> is not recognized. This limitation is tracked by the issue\n        <a class=\"hue-doc-external-link\" href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/IMPALA-3334\" target=\"_blank\">IMPALA-3334</a>, which shows the releases where the\n        problem is fixed.\n      </div><p id=\"usage_notes_blurb\"><b>Usage notes:</b></p><p>\n      Typically, queries that would require enabling this option involve very large numbers of\n      aggregated values, such as a billion or more distinct keys being processed on each\n      worker node.\n    </p><p id=\"added_in_250\"><b>Added in:</b>Impala 2.5.0</p></div></div></div>","title":"DISABLE_STREAMING_PREAGGREGATIONS Query Option (Impala 2.5 or higher only)"}
