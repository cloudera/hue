{"body":"<div><div id=\"databases\"><div class=\"hue-doc-title\">Overview of Impala Databases</div><div><p>\n      In Impala, a database is a logical container for a group of tables. Each database defines a separate\n      namespace. Within a database, you can refer to the tables inside it using their unqualified names. Different\n      databases can contain tables with identical names.\n    </p><p> Creating a database is a lightweight operation. There are minimal\n      database-specific properties to configure, such as\n        <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">LOCATION</span> and <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">COMMENT</span>. </p><p>You can change the owner of a database with the <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">ALTER\n        DATABASE</span> statement. </p><p>\n      Typically, you create a separate database for each project or application, to avoid naming conflicts between\n      tables and to make clear which tables are related to each other. The <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">USE</span> statement lets\n      you switch between databases. Unqualified references to tables, views, and functions refer to objects\n      within the current database. You can also refer to objects in other databases by using qualified names\n      of the form <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\"><span class=\"hue-doc-varname\">dbname</span>.<span class=\"hue-doc-varname\">object_name</span></span>.\n    </p><p>\n      Each database is physically represented by a directory in HDFS. When you do not specify a <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">LOCATION</span>\n      attribute, the directory is located in the Impala data directory with the associated tables managed by Impala.\n      When you do specify a <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">LOCATION</span> attribute, any read and write operations for tables in that\n      database are relative to the specified HDFS directory.\n    </p><p>\n      There is a special database, named <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">default</span>, where you begin when you connect to Impala.\n      Tables created in <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">default</span> are physically located one level higher in HDFS than all the\n      user-created databases.\n    </p><p id=\"builtins_db\">\n        Impala includes another predefined database, <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">_impala_builtins</span>, that\n        serves as the location for the\n        <a class=\"hue-doc-internal-link\" href=\"javascript:void(0);\" data-doc-ref=\"topics/impala_functions.xml\" data-doc-anchor-id=\"builtins\">built-in functions</a>. To see\n        the built-in functions, use a statement like the following:\n<div class=\"hue-doc-codeblock\">show functions in _impala_builtins;\nshow functions in _impala_builtins like '*<span class=\"hue-doc-varname\">substring</span>*';\n</div></p><p><b>Related statements:</b></p><p><a class=\"hue-doc-internal-link\" href=\"javascript:void(0);\" data-doc-ref=\"topics/impala_create_database.xml\" data-doc-anchor-id=\"create_database\">CREATE DATABASE Statement</a>,\n      <a class=\"hue-doc-internal-link\" href=\"javascript:void(0);\" data-doc-ref=\"topics/impala_drop_database.xml\" data-doc-anchor-id=\"drop_database\">DROP DATABASE Statement</a>, <a class=\"hue-doc-internal-link\" href=\"javascript:void(0);\" data-doc-ref=\"topics/impala_use.xml\" data-doc-anchor-id=\"use\">USE Statement</a>,\n      <a class=\"hue-doc-internal-link\" href=\"javascript:void(0);\" data-doc-ref=\"topics/impala_show.xml\" data-doc-anchor-id=\"show_databases\">SHOW DATABASES</a></p></div></div></div>","title":"Overview of Impala Databases"}
