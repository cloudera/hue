You might need to\n            convert the underlying data to Parquet to use it with Impala.\n          </p></li><li><p>\n            Your data model originates with a non-SQL programming language or a NoSQL data management system. For example, if you are\n            representing Python data expressed as nested lists, dictionaries, and tuples, those data structures correspond closely to Impala\n            <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">ARRAY</span>, <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">MAP</span>, and <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">STRUCT</span> types.\n          </p></li><li><p>\n            Your analytic queries involving multiple tables could benefit from greater locality during join processing. By packing more\n            related data items within each HDFS data block, complex types let join queries avoid the network overhead of the traditional\n            Hadoop shuffle or broadcast join techniques.\n          </p></li></ul><p>\n        The Impala complex type support produces result sets with all scalar values, and the scalar components of complex types can be used\n        with all SQL clauses, such as <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">GROUP BY</span>, <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">ORDER BY</span>, all kinds of joins, subqueries, and inline\n        views. The ability to process complex type data entirely in SQL reduces the need to write application-specific code in Java or other\n        programming languages to deconstruct the underlying data structures.\n      </p></div></div><div id=\"complex_types_overview\"><div class=\"hue-doc-title\">Overview of Impala Complex Types</div><div><p>\n        The <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">ARRAY</span> and <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">MAP</span> types are closely related: they represent collections with arbitrary numbers of\n        elements, where each element is the same type. In contrast, <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">STRUCT</span> groups together a fixed number of items into a\n        single element. The parts of a <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">STRUCT</span> element (the <span class=\"hue-doc-term\">fields</span>) can be of different types, and each field\n        has a name.\n      </p><p>\n        The elements of an <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">ARRAY</span> or <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">MAP</span>, or the fields of a <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">STRUCT</span>, can also be other\n        complex types. You can construct elaborate data structures with up to 100 levels of nesting. For example, you can make an\n        <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">ARRAY</span> whose elements are <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">STRUCT</span>s. Within each <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">STRUCT</span>, you can have some fields\n        that are <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">ARRAY</span>, <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">MAP</span>, or another kind of <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">STRUCT</span>. The Impala documentation uses the\n        terms complex and nested types interchangeably; for simplicity, it primarily uses the term complex types, to encompass all the\n        properties of these types.\n      </p><p>\n        When visualizing your data model in familiar SQL terms, you can think of each <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">ARRAY</span> or <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">MAP</span> as a\n        miniature table, and each <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">STRUCT</span> as a row within such a table. By default, the table represented by an\n        <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">ARRAY</span> has two columns, <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">POS</span> to represent ordering of elements, and <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">ITEM</span>\n        representing the value of each element. Likewise, by default, the table represented by a <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">MAP</span> encodes key-value\n        pairs, and therefore has two columns, <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">KEY</span> and <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">VALUE</span>.\n</p><p>\n        The <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">ITEM</span> and <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">VALUE</span> names are only required for the very simplest kinds of <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">ARRAY</span>\n        and <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">MAP</span> columns, ones that hold only scalar values. When the elements within the <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">ARRAY</span> or\n        <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">MAP</span> are of type <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">STRUCT</span> rather than a scalar type, then the result set contains columns with names\n        corresponding to the <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">STRUCT</span> fields rather than <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">ITEM</span> or <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">VALUE</span>.\n      </p><p>\n        You write most queries that process complex type columns using familiar join syntax, even though the data for both sides of the join\n        resides in a single table. The join notation brings together the scalar values from a row with the values from the complex type\n        columns for that same row. The final result set contains all scalar values, allowing you to do all the familiar filtering,\n        aggregation, ordering, and so on for the complex data entirely in SQL or using business intelligence tools that issue SQL queries.\n</p><p>\n        Behind the scenes, Impala ensures that the processing for each row is done efficiently on a single host, without the network traffic\n        involved in broadcast or shuffle joins. The most common type of join query for tables with complex type columns is <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">INNER\n        JOIN</span>, which returns results only in those cases where the complex type contains some elements. Therefore, most query\n        examples in this section use either the <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">INNER JOIN</span> clause or the equivalent comma notation.\n      </p><div class=\"hue-doc-note\"><p>\n          Although Impala can query complex types that are present in Parquet files, Impala currently cannot create new Parquet files\n          containing complex types. Therefore, the discussion and examples presume that you are working with existing Parquet data produced\n          through Hive, Spark, or some other source.

Because you might have already encountered\n        complex types in a Hadoop context while using Hive for ETL, also learn how to write high-performance analytic queries for complex\n        type data using Impala SQL syntax.\n      </p><p/></div><div id=\"complex_types_vs_rdbms\"><div class=\"hue-doc-title\">How Complex Types Differ from Traditional Data Warehouse Schemas</div><div><p>\n          Complex types let you associate arbitrary data structures with a particular row. If you are familiar with schema design for\n          relational database management systems or data warehouses, a schema with complex types has the following differences:\n        </p><ul><li><p>\n              Logically, related values can now be grouped tightly together in the same table.\n            </p><p>\n              In traditional data warehousing, related values were typically arranged in one of two ways:\n            </p><ul><li><p>\n                  Split across multiple normalized tables. Foreign key columns specified which rows from each table were associated with\n                  each other. This arrangement avoided duplicate data and therefore the data was compact, but join queries could be\n                  expensive because the related data had to be retrieved from separate locations. (In the case of distributed Hadoop\n                  queries, the joined tables might even be transmitted between different hosts in a cluster.)\n                </p></li><li><p>\n                  Flattened into a single denormalized table. Although this layout eliminated some potential performance issues by removing\n                  the need for join queries, the table typically became larger because values were repeated. The extra data volume could\n                  cause performance issues in other parts of the workflow, such as longer ETL cycles or more expensive full-table scans\n                  during queries.\n                </p></li></ul><p>\n              Complex types represent a middle ground that addresses these performance and volume concerns. By physically locating related\n              data within the same data files, complex types increase locality and reduce the expense of join queries. By associating an\n              arbitrary amount of data with a single row, complex types avoid the need to repeat lengthy values such as strings. Because\n              Impala knows which complex type values are associated with each row, you can save storage by avoiding artificial foreign key\n              values that are only used for joins. The flexibility of the <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">STRUCT</span>, <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">ARRAY</span>, and\n              <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">MAP</span> types lets you model familiar constructs such as fact and dimension tables from a data warehouse, and\n              wide tables representing sparse matrixes.\n            </p></li></ul></div></div><div id=\"complex_types_physical\"><div class=\"hue-doc-title\">Physical Storage for Complex Types in Parquet</div><div><p>\n          Physically, the scalar and complex columns in each row are located adjacent to each other in the same Parquet data file, ensuring\n          that they are processed on the same host rather than being broadcast across the network when cross-referenced within a query. This\n          co-location simplifies the process of copying, converting, and backing all the columns up at once. Because of the column-oriented\n          layout of Parquet files, you can still query only the scalar columns of a table without imposing the I/O penalty of reading the\n          (possibly large) values of the composite columns.\n        </p><p>\n          Within each Parquet data file, the constituent parts of complex type columns are stored in column-oriented format:\n        </p><ul><li><p>\n              Each field of a <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">STRUCT</span> type is stored like a column, with all the scalar values adjacent to each other and\n              encoded, compressed, and so on using the Parquet space-saving techniques.\n            </p></li><li><p>\n              For an <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">ARRAY</span> containing scalar values, all those values (represented by the <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">ITEM</span>\n              pseudocolumn) are stored adjacent to each other.\n            </p></li><li><p>\n              For a <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">MAP</span>, the values of the <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">KEY</span> pseudocolumn are stored adjacent to each other. If the\n              <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">VALUE</span> pseudocolumn is a scalar type, its values are also stored adjacent to each other.\n            </p></li><li><p>\n              If an <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">ARRAY</span> element, <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">STRUCT</span> field, or <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">MAP</span><span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">VALUE</span> part is\n              another complex type, the column-oriented storage applies to the next level down (or the next level after that, and so on for\n              deeply nested types) where the final elements, fields, or values are of scalar types.\n            </p></li></ul><p>\n          The numbers represented by the <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">POS</span> pseudocolumn of an <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">ARRAY</span> are not physically stored in the\n          data files. They are synthesized at query time based on the order of the <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">ARRAY</span> elements associated with each row.\n        </p></div></div><div id=\"complex_types_file_formats\"><div class=\"hue-doc-title\">File Format Support for Impala Complex Types</div><div><p> Currently, Impala queries support complex type data in the Parquet\n          and ORC file formats.

Also, if a table using an unsupported format originally contained nested type columns, and then those columns were\n          dropped from the table using <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">ALTER TABLE ... DROP COLUMN</span>, any existing data files in the table still contain the\n          nested type data and Impala queries on that table will generate errors.\n        </p><p>\n            The one exception to the preceding rule is <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">COUNT(*)</span> queries on RCFile tables that include complex types.\n            Such queries are allowed in Impala 2.6 and higher.\n        </p><p>\n          You can perform DDL operations for tables involving complex types in\n          most file formats other than Parquet or ORC. You cannot create tables\n          in Impala with complex types using text files.\n        </p><p>\n          You can have a partitioned table with complex type columns that uses\n          a format other than Parquet or ORC, and use\n          <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">ALTER TABLE</span> to change the file format to Parquet/ORC\n          for individual partitions. When you put Parquet/ORC files into those\n          partitions, Impala can execute queries against that data as long as\n          the query does not involve any of the non-Parquet and non-ORC\n          partitions.\n        </p><p>\n          If you use the <span class=\"hue-doc-cmdname\">parquet-tools</span> command to examine the structure of a Parquet data file that includes complex\n          types, you see that both <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">ARRAY</span> and <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">MAP</span> are represented as a <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">Bag</span> in Parquet\n          terminology, with all fields marked <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">Optional</span> because Impala allows any column to be nullable.\n        </p><p>\n          Impala supports either 2-level and 3-level encoding within each Parquet data file.

Your business intelligence tools might already be optimized for dealing with this kind of multi-table scenario\n              through join queries.\n            </p></li><li><p>\n              If you are pulling data from Impala into an application written in a programming language that has data structures analogous\n              to the complex types, such as Python or Java, complex types in Impala could simplify data interchange and improve\n              understandability and reliability of your program logic.\n            </p></li><li><p>\n              You might already be faced with existing infrastructure or receive high volumes of data that assume one layout or the other.\n              For example, complex types are popular with web-oriented applications, for example to keep information about an online user\n              all in one place for convenient lookup and analysis, or to deal with sparse or constantly evolving data fields.\n            </p></li><li><p>\n              If some parts of the data change over time while related data remains constant, using multiple normalized tables lets you\n              replace certain parts of the data without reloading the entire data set. Conversely, if you receive related data all bundled\n              together, such as in JSON files, using complex types can save the overhead of splitting the related items across multiple\n              tables.\n            </p></li><li><p>\n              From a performance perspective:\n            </p><ul><li><p>\n                  In Parquet or ORC tables, Impala can skip columns that are not referenced in a query, avoiding the I/O penalty of reading the\n                  embedded data. When complex types are nested within a column, the data is physically divided at a very granular level; for\n                  example, a query referring to data nested multiple levels deep in a complex type column does not have to read all the data\n                  from that column, only the data for the relevant parts of the column type hierarchy.\n</p></li><li><p>\n                  Complex types avoid the possibility of expensive join queries when data from fact and dimension tables is processed in\n                  parallel across multiple hosts. All the information for a row containing complex types is typically to be in the same data\n                  block, and therefore does not need to be transmitted across the network when joining fields that are all part of the same\n                  row.\n                </p></li><li><p>\n                  The tradeoff with complex types is that fewer rows fit in each data block. Whether it is better to have more data blocks\n                  with fewer rows, or fewer data blocks with many rows, depends on the distribution of your data and the characteristics of\n                  your query workload. If the complex columns are rarely referenced, using them might lower efficiency. If you are seeing\n                  low parallelism due to a small volume of data (relatively few data blocks) in each table partition, increasing the row\n                  size by including complex columns might produce more data blocks and thus spread the work more evenly across the cluster.\n                  See <a class=\"hue-doc-internal-link\" href=\"javascript:void(0);\" data-doc-ref=\"topics/impala_scalability.xml\" data-doc-anchor-id=\"scalability\">Scalability Considerations for Impala</a> for more on this advanced topic.\n                </p></li></ul></li></ul></div></div><div id=\"complex_types_hive\"><div class=\"hue-doc-title\">Differences Between Impala and Hive Complex Types</div><div><p>\n          Impala can query Parquet and ORC tables containing <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">ARRAY</span>, <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">STRUCT</span>, and <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">MAP</span> columns\n          produced by Hive.

That is, each of these types can contain other complex or scalar types, with multiple levels of nesting to a\n          maximum depth of 100. For example, you can have an array of structures, a map containing other maps, a structure containing an\n          array of other structures, and so on. At the lowest level, there are always scalar types making up the fields of a\n          <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">STRUCT</span>, elements of an <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">ARRAY</span>, and keys and values of a <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">MAP</span>.\n        </p><p>\n          Schemas involving complex types typically use some level of nesting for the complex type columns.\n        </p><p>\n          For example, to model a relationship like a dimension table and a fact table, you typically use an <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">ARRAY</span> where\n          each array element is a <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">STRUCT</span>. The <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">STRUCT</span> fields represent what would traditionally be columns\n          in a separate joined table.

The key values are not predefined ahead of time (other than by\n          specifying their data type). Therefore, the <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">MAP</span> can accomodate a rapidly evolving schema, or sparse data\n          structures where each row contains only a few data values drawn from a large set of possible choices.\n        </p><p>\n          Although you can use an <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">ARRAY</span> of scalar values as the top-level column in a table, such a simple array is\n          typically of limited use for analytic queries. The only property of the array elements, aside from the element value, is the\n          ordering sequence available through the <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">POS</span> pseudocolumn. To record any additional item about each array element,\n          such as a <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">TIMESTAMP</span> or a symbolic name, you use an <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">ARRAY</span> of <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">STRUCT</span> rather than\n          of scalar values.\n        </p><p>\n          If you are considering having multiple <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">ARRAY</span> or <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">MAP</span> columns, with related items under the same\n          position in each <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">ARRAY</span> or the same key in each <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">MAP</span>, prefer to use a <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">STRUCT</span> to\n          group all the related items into a single <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">ARRAY</span> or <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">MAP</span>. Doing so avoids the additional storage\n          overhead and potential duplication of key values from having an extra complex type column.

The complex type columns reside in the same data files\n          rather than in separate normalized tables, for your convenience in managing related data sets and performance in querying related\n          data sets. You can use views to treat tables with complex types as if they were flattened. By putting the join logic and\n          references to the complex type columns in the view definition, you can query the same tables using existing queries intended for\n          tables containing only scalar columns. This technique also lets you use tables with complex types with BI tools that are not aware\n          of the data types and query notation for accessing complex type columns.\n        </p><p>\n          For example, the variation of the TPC-H schema containing complex types has a table <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">REGION</span>. This table has 5\n          rows, corresponding to 5 regions such as <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">NORTH AMERICA</span> and <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">AFRICA</span>. Each row has an\n          <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">ARRAY</span> column, where each array item is a <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">STRUCT</span> containing details about a country in that\n          region.\n        </p><div class=\"hue-doc-codeblock\">DESCRIBE region;\n+-------------+-------------------------+\n| name        | type                    |\n+-------------+-------------------------+\n| r_regionkey | smallint                |\n| r_name      | string                  |\n| r_comment   | string                  |\n| r_nations   | array&lt;struct&lt;           |\n|             |   n_nationkey:smallint, |\n|             |   n_name:string,        |\n|             |   n_comment:string      |\n|             | &gt;&gt;                      |\n+-------------+-------------------------+\n</div><p>\n          The same data could be represented in traditional denormalized form, as a single table where the information about each region is\n          repeated over and over, alongside the information about each country. The nested complex types let us avoid the repetition, while\n          still keeping the data in a single table rather than normalizing across multiple tables.\n        </p><p>\n          To use this table with a JDBC or ODBC application that expected scalar columns, we could create a view that represented the result\n          set as a set of scalar columns (three columns from the original table, plus three more from the <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">STRUCT</span> fields of\n          the array elements). In the following examples, any column with an <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">R_*</span> prefix is taken unchanged from the\n          original table, while any column with an <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">N_*</span> prefix is extracted from the <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">STRUCT</span> inside the\n          <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">ARRAY</span>.\n        </p><div class=\"hue-doc-codeblock\">CREATE VIEW region_view AS\n  SELECT\n    r_regionkey,\n    r_name,\n    r_comment,\n    array_field.item.n_nationkey AS n_nationkey,\n    array_field.item.n_name AS n_name,\n    array_field.n_comment AS n_comment\nFROM\n  region, region.r_nations AS array_field;\n</div><p>\n          Then we point the application queries at the view rather than the original table.
