{"body":"<div><div id=\"perf_benchmarks\"><div class=\"hue-doc-title\">Benchmarking Impala Queries</div><div><p>\n      Because Impala, like other Hadoop components, is designed to handle large data volumes in a distributed\n      environment, conduct any performance tests using realistic data and cluster configurations. Use a multi-node\n      cluster rather than a single node; run queries against tables containing terabytes of data rather than tens\n      of gigabytes. The parallel processing techniques used by Impala are most appropriate for workloads that are\n      beyond the capacity of a single server.\n    </p><p>\n      When you run queries returning large numbers of rows, the CPU time to pretty-print the output can be\n      substantial, giving an inaccurate measurement of the actual query time. Consider using the\n      <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">-B</span> option on the <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">impala-shell</span> command to turn off the pretty-printing, and\n      optionally the <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">-o</span> option to store query results in a file rather than printing to the\n      screen. See <a class=\"hue-doc-internal-link\" href=\"javascript:void(0);\" data-doc-ref=\"topics/impala_shell_options.xml\" data-doc-anchor-id=\"shell_options\">impala-shell Configuration Options</a> for details.\n    </p></div></div></div>","title":"Benchmarking Impala Queries"}
