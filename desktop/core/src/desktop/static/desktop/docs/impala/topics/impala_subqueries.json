{"body":"<div><div id=\"subqueries\"><div class=\"hue-doc-title\">Subqueries in Impala SELECT Statements</div><div><p>\n      A <span class=\"hue-doc-term\">subquery</span> is a query that is nested within another query. Subqueries let queries on one table\n      dynamically adapt based on the contents of another table. This technique provides great flexibility and\n      expressive power for SQL queries.\n    </p><p>\n      A subquery can return a result set for use in the <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">FROM</span> or <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">WITH</span> clauses, or\n      with operators such as <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">IN</span> or <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">EXISTS</span>.\n    </p><p>\n      A <span class=\"hue-doc-term\">scalar subquery</span> produces a result set with a single row containing a single column, typically\n      produced by an aggregation function such as <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">MAX()</span> or <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">SUM()</span>. This single\n      result value can be substituted in scalar contexts such as arguments to comparison operators. If the result\n      set is empty, the value of the scalar subquery is <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">NULL</span>. For example, the following query\n      finds the maximum value of <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">T2.Y</span> and then substitutes that value into the\n      <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">WHERE</span> clause of the outer block that queries <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">T1</span>:\n    </p><div class=\"hue-doc-codeblock\">SELECT x FROM t1 WHERE x &gt; (SELECT MAX(y) FROM t2);\n</div><p><span class=\"hue-doc-term\">Uncorrelated subqueries</span> do not refer to any tables from the outer block of the query. The same\n      value or set of values produced by the subquery is used when evaluating each row from the outer query block.\n      In this example, the subquery returns an arbitrary number of values from <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">T2.Y</span>, and each\n      value of <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">T1.X</span> is tested for membership in that same set of values:\n    </p><div class=\"hue-doc-codeblock\">SELECT x FROM t1 WHERE x IN (SELECT y FROM t2);\n</div><p><span class=\"hue-doc-term\">Correlated subqueries</span> compare one or more values from the outer query block to values referenced\n      in the <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">WHERE</span> clause of the subquery. Each row evaluated by the outer <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">WHERE</span>\n      clause can be evaluated using a different set of values. These kinds of subqueries are restricted in the\n      kinds of comparisons they can do between columns of the inner and outer tables. (See the following\n      <b>Restrictions</b> item.)\n    </p><p>\n      For example, the following query finds all the employees with salaries that are higher than average for their\n      department. The subquery potentially computes a different <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">AVG()</span> value for each employee.\n    </p><div class=\"hue-doc-codeblock\">SELECT employee_name, employee_id FROM employees one WHERE\n  salary &gt; (SELECT avg(salary) FROM employees two WHERE one.dept_id = two.dept_id);\n</div><p id=\"syntax_blurb\"><b>Syntax:</b></p><p><b>Subquery in the <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">FROM</span> clause:</b></p><div class=\"hue-doc-codeblock\">SELECT <span class=\"hue-doc-varname\">select_list</span> FROM <span class=\"hue-doc-varname\">table_ref</span> [, <span class=\"hue-doc-varname\">table_ref</span> ...]\n\n<span class=\"hue-doc-varname\">table_ref</span> ::= <span class=\"hue-doc-varname\">table_name</span> | (<span class=\"hue-doc-varname\">select_statement</span>)\n</div><p><b>Subqueries in <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">WHERE</span> clause:</b></p><div class=\"hue-doc-codeblock\">WHERE <span class=\"hue-doc-varname\">value</span><span class=\"hue-doc-varname\">comparison_operator</span> (<span class=\"hue-doc-varname\">scalar_select_statement</span>)\nWHERE <span class=\"hue-doc-varname\">value</span> [NOT] IN (<span class=\"hue-doc-varname\">select_statement</span>)\nWHERE [NOT] EXISTS (<span class=\"hue-doc-varname\">correlated_select_statement</span>)\nWHERE NOT EXISTS (<span class=\"hue-doc-varname\">correlated_select_statement</span>)\n</div><p><span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">comparison_operator</span> is a numeric comparison such as <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">=</span>,\n      <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">&lt;=</span>, <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">!=</span>, and so on, or a string comparison operator such as\n      <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">LIKE</span> or <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">REGEXP</span>.\n    </p><p>\n      Although you can use non-equality comparison operators such as <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">&lt;</span> or\n      <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">&gt;=</span>, the subquery must include at least one equality comparison between the columns of the\n      inner and outer query blocks.\n    </p><p>\n      All syntax is available for both correlated and uncorrelated queries, except that the <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">NOT\n      EXISTS</span> clause cannot be used with an uncorrelated subquery.\n    </p><p>\n      Impala subqueries can be nested arbitrarily deep.\n    </p><p id=\"sql1999\"><b>Standards compliance:</b> Introduced in\n      <a class=\"hue-doc-external-link\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL:1999\" target=\"_blank\">SQL:1999</a>.\n    </p><p id=\"example_blurb\"><b>Examples:</b></p><p>\n      This example illustrates how subqueries can be used in the <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">FROM</span> clause to organize the table\n      names, column names, and column values by producing intermediate result sets, especially for join queries.\n    </p><div class=\"hue-doc-codeblock\">SELECT avg(t1.x), max(t2.y) FROM\n  (SELECT id, cast(a AS DECIMAL(10,5)) AS x FROM raw_data WHERE a BETWEEN 0 AND 100) AS t1\n  JOIN\n  (SELECT id, length(s) AS y FROM raw_data WHERE s LIKE 'A%') AS t2;\n  USING (id);\n</div><p>\n      These examples show how a query can test for the existence of values in a separate table using the\n      <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">EXISTS()</span> operator with a subquery.\n</p><p>\n      The following examples show how a value can be compared against a set of values returned by a subquery.\n    </p><div class=\"hue-doc-codeblock\">SELECT count(x) FROM t1 WHERE EXISTS(SELECT 1 FROM t2 WHERE t1.x = t2.y * 10);\n\nSELECT x FROM t1 WHERE x IN (SELECT y FROM t2 WHERE state = 'CA');\n</div><p>\n      The following examples demonstrate scalar subqueries.

Run the\n      <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">COMPUTE STATS</span> statement for each associated tables after loading or substantially changing\n      the data in that table. See <a class=\"hue-doc-external-link\" href=\"https://www.cloudera.com/documentation/enterprise/latest/topics/impala_perf_stats.html#perf_stats\" target=\"_blank\">Table and Column Statistics</a> for details.\n    </p><p><b>Added in:</b> Subqueries are substantially enhanced starting in Impala 2.0. Now,\n      they can be used in the <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">WHERE</span> clause, in combination with clauses such as\n      <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">EXISTS</span> and <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">IN</span>, rather than just in the <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">FROM</span> clause.\n    </p><p id=\"restrictions_blurb\"><b>Restrictions:</b></p><p>\n      The initial Impala support for nested subqueries addresses the most common use cases.

(Impala does not currently have a <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">SOME</span> operator, but if it did,\n          the same restriction would apply.)\n        </p></li><li><p>\n          For the <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">EXISTS</span> and <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">NOT EXISTS</span> clauses, any subquery comparing values\n          from the outer query block to another table must use at least one equality comparison, not exclusively\n          other kinds of comparisons such as less than, greater than, <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">BETWEEN</span>, or\n          <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">!=</span>.\n        </p></li><li><p>\n          Currently, a scalar subquery cannot be used as the first or second argument to the\n          <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">BETWEEN</span> operator.\n        </p></li><li><p>\n          A subquery cannot be used inside an <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">OR</span> conjunction.
