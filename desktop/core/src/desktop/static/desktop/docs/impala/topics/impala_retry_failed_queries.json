If a SELECT query fails due to a cluster membership\n      change, the Coordinator will cancel and unregister the running query and then launch a retry\n      of the query. For example, if one of the executor nodes fails during query execution, the query\n      fails but is transparently re-executed, either with the executor node immediately replaced, or\n      with a temporarily reduced number of executor nodes. This feature supports retrying the\n      entire query and NOT the individual query fragments. INSERT and DDL queries will NOT be\n      retried.</p><p>Note that query retry will be skipped if the query has returned any results to the client. To\n      avoid this, enable <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">Result Spooling</span> and set the\n        <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">spool_all_results_for_retries</span> query option.</p><p><b>Type:</b><span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">BOOLEAN</span></p><p><b>Default:</b><span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">TRUE</span></p><p><b>Added in:</b>Impala 4.0</p><p><b>Related information:</b><a class=\"hue-doc-internal-link\" href=\"javascript:void(0);\" data-doc-ref=\"topics/impala_transparent_query_retries.xml\">Impala Transparent Query Retries</a></p></div></div></div>","title":"RETRY_FAILED_QUERIES Query Option"}
