{"body":"<div><div id=\"fault_tolerance\"><div class=\"hue-doc-title\">Impala Fault Tolerance</div><div><p>\n      This section describes the fault tolerance mechanisms built into\n      Impala. Fault tolerance allows Impala to continue to operate in the\n      face of hardware or process faults.\n    </p><p>\n      Impala uses the statestored process to provide cluster membership for\n      an Impala cluster. This is one of the core ways Impala provides fault\n      tolerance. The statestore periodically sends heartbeats (RPCs) to each\n      impalad process. If an impalad stops responding to heartbeats, the\n      statestored will consider the impalad as failed, and it will remove it\n      from the cluster membership state. The updates to the cluster\n      membership will be broadcasted to all impalads.\n    </p></div></div></div>","title":"Impala Fault Tolerance"}
