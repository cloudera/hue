This can require more memory capacity\n      than a query without <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">ORDER BY</span>. Even if the query takes approximately the same time to finish\n      with or without the <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">ORDER BY</span> clause, subjectively it can appear slower because no results\n      are available until all processing is finished, rather than results coming back gradually as rows matching\n      the <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">WHERE</span> clause are found. Therefore, if you only need the first N results from the sorted\n      result set, also include the <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">LIMIT</span> clause, which reduces network overhead and the memory\n      requirement on the coordinator node.\n    </p><div class=\"hue-doc-note\"><p>\n        In Impala 1.4.0 and higher, the <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">LIMIT</span> clause is now optional (rather than required) for\n        queries that use the <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">ORDER BY</span> clause.

For example, if the query has a clause <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">LIMIT 10</span>, each data\n      node sorts its portion of the relevant result set and only returns 10 rows to the coordinator node. The\n      coordinator node picks the 10 highest or lowest row values out of this small intermediate result set.\n    </p><p>\n      If an <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">ORDER BY</span> clause is applied to an early phase of query processing, such as a subquery\n      or a view definition, Impala ignores the <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">ORDER BY</span> clause. To get ordered results from a\n      subquery or view, apply an <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">ORDER BY</span> clause to the outermost or final <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">SELECT</span>\n      level.\n    </p><p><span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">ORDER BY</span> is often used in combination with <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">LIMIT</span> to perform <q>top-N</q>\n      queries:\n    </p><div class=\"hue-doc-codeblock\">SELECT user_id AS \"Top 10 Visitors\", SUM(page_views) FROM web_stats\n  GROUP BY page_views, user_id\n  ORDER BY SUM(page_views) DESC LIMIT 10;\n</div><p><span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">ORDER BY</span> is sometimes used in combination with <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">OFFSET</span> and\n      <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">LIMIT</span> to paginate query results, although it is relatively inefficient to issue multiple\n      queries like this against the large tables typically used with Impala:\n    </p><div class=\"hue-doc-codeblock\">SELECT page_title AS \"Page 1 of search results\", page_url FROM search_content\n  WHERE LOWER(page_title) LIKE '%game%')\n  ORDER BY page_title LIMIT 10 OFFSET 0;\nSELECT page_title AS \"Page 2 of search results\", page_url FROM search_content\n  WHERE LOWER(page_title) LIKE '%game%')\n  ORDER BY page_title LIMIT 10 OFFSET 10;\nSELECT page_title AS \"Page 3 of search results\", page_url FROM search_content\n  WHERE LOWER(page_title) LIKE '%game%')\n  ORDER BY page_title LIMIT 10 OFFSET 20;\n</div><p><b>Internal details:</b></p><p>\n      Impala sorts the intermediate results of an <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">ORDER BY</span> clause in memory whenever practical. In\n      a cluster of N DataNodes, each node sorts roughly 1/Nth of the result set, the exact proportion varying\n      depending on how the data matching the query is distributed in HDFS.\n    </p><p>\n      If the size of the sorted intermediate result set on any DataNode would cause the query to exceed the Impala\n      memory limit, Impala sorts as much as practical in memory, then writes partially sorted data to disk. (This\n      technique is known in industry terminology as <q>external sorting</q> and <q>spilling to disk</q>.) As each\n      8 MB batch of data is written to disk, Impala frees the corresponding memory to sort a new 8 MB batch of\n      data. When all the data has been processed, a final merge sort operation is performed to correctly order the\n      in-memory and on-disk results as the result set is transmitted back to the coordinator node. When external\n      sorting becomes necessary, Impala requires approximately 60 MB of RAM at a minimum for the buffers needed to\n      read, write, and sort the intermediate results. If more RAM is available on the DataNode, Impala will use\n      the additional RAM to minimize the amount of disk I/O for sorting.\n    </p><p>\n      This external sort technique is used as appropriate on each DataNode (possibly including the coordinator\n      node) to sort the portion of the result set that is processed on that node. When the sorted intermediate\n      results are sent back to the coordinator node to produce the final result set, the coordinator node uses a\n      merge sort technique to produce a final sorted result set without using any extra resources on the\n      coordinator node.\n    </p><p><b>Configuration for disk usage:</b></p><p>\n        By default, intermediate files used during large sort, join, aggregation, or analytic function operations\n        are stored in the directory <span class=\"hue-doc-filepath\">/tmp/impala-scratch</span> . These files are removed when the\n        operation finishes. (Multiple concurrent queries can perform operations that use the <q>spill to disk</q>\n        technique, without any name conflicts for these temporary files.) You can specify a different location by\n        starting the <span class=\"hue-doc-cmdname\">impalad</span> daemon with the\n        <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">--scratch_dirs=\"<span class=\"hue-doc-varname\">path_to_directory</span>\"</span> configuration option.\n        You can specify a single directory, or a comma-separated list of directories. The scratch directories must\n        be on the local filesystem, not in HDFS. You might specify different directory paths for different hosts,\n        depending on the capacity and speed\n        of the available storage devices. In Impala 2.3 or higher, Impala successfully starts (with a warning\n        Impala successfully starts (with a warning written to the log) if it cannot create or read and write files\n        in one of the scratch directories. If there is less than 1 GB free on the filesystem where that directory resides,\n        Impala still runs, but writes a warning message to its log.  If Impala encounters an error reading or writing\n        files in a scratch directory during a query, Impala logs the error and the query fails.\n      </p><p><b>Sorting considerations:</b> Although you can specify an <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">ORDER BY</span> clause in an\n        <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">INSERT ... SELECT</span> statement, any <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">ORDER BY</span> clause is ignored and the\n        results are not necessarily sorted. An <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">INSERT ... SELECT</span> operation potentially creates\n        many different data files, prepared on different data nodes, and therefore the notion of the data being\n        stored in sorted order is impractical.\n      </p><p>\n        An <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">ORDER BY</span> clause without an additional <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">LIMIT</span> clause is ignored in any\n        view definition. If you need to sort the entire result set from a view, use an <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">ORDER BY</span>\n        clause in the <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">SELECT</span> statement that queries the view.
