{"body":"<div><div id=\"disable_codegen\"><div class=\"hue-doc-title\">DISABLE_CODEGEN Query Option</div><div><p>\n      This is a debug option, intended for diagnosing and working around issues that cause crashes. If a query\n      fails with an <q>illegal instruction</q> or other hardware-specific message, try setting\n      <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">DISABLE_CODEGEN=true</span> and running the query again. If the query succeeds only when the\n      <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">DISABLE_CODEGEN</span> option is turned on, submit the problem to the appropriate support channel and include that\n      detail in the problem report. Do not otherwise run with this setting turned on, because it results in lower\n      overall performance.\n    </p><p>\n      Because the code generation phase adds a small amount of overhead for each query, you might turn on the\n      <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">DISABLE_CODEGEN</span> option to achieve maximum throughput when running many short-lived queries\n      against small tables.\n    </p><p id=\"type_boolean\"><b>Type:</b> Boolean; recognized values are 1 and 0, or <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">true</span> and <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">false</span>;\n        any other value interpreted as <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">false</span></p><p id=\"default_false_0\"><b>Default:</b><span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">false</span> (shown as 0 in output of <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">SET</span> statement)\n      </p></div></div></div>","title":"DISABLE_CODEGEN Query Option"}
