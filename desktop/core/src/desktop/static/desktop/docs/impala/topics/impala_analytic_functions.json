{"body":"<div><div id=\"analytic_functions\"><div class=\"hue-doc-title\">Impala Analytic Functions</div><div><p> Analytic functions (also known as window functions) are a\n      special category of built-in functions. Like aggregate functions, they\n      examine the contents of multiple input rows to compute each output value.\n      However, rather than being limited to one result value per <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">GROUP\n        BY</span> group, they operate on <span class=\"hue-doc-term\">windows</span> where the input\n      rows are ordered and grouped using flexible conditions expressed through\n      an <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">OVER()</span> clause. </p><p id=\"added_in_20\"><b>Added in:</b>Impala 2.0.0</p><p>\n      Some functions, such as <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">LAG()</span> and <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">RANK()</span>, can only be used in this analytic\n      context. Some aggregate functions do double duty: when you call the aggregation functions such as\n      <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">MAX()</span>, <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">SUM()</span>, <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">AVG()</span>, and so on with an\n      <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">OVER()</span> clause, they produce an output value for each row, based on computations across other\n      rows in the window.\n    </p><p>\n      Although analytic functions often compute the same value you would see from an aggregate function in a\n      <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">GROUP BY</span> query, the analytic functions produce a value for each row in the result set rather\n      than a single value for each group. This flexibility lets you include additional columns in the\n      <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">SELECT</span> list, offering more opportunities for organizing and filtering the result set.\n    </p><p>\n      Analytic function calls are only allowed in the <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">SELECT</span> list and in the outermost\n      <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">ORDER BY</span> clause of the query. During query processing, analytic functions are evaluated\n      after other query stages such as joins, <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">WHERE</span>, and <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">GROUP BY</span>,\n    </p><p>\n      The rows that are part of each partition are analyzed by computations across an ordered or unordered set of\n      rows. For example, <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">COUNT()</span> and <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">SUM()</span> might be applied to all the rows in\n      the partition, in which case the order of analysis does not matter. The <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">ORDER BY</span> clause\n      might be used inside the <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">OVER()</span> clause to defines the ordering that applies to functions\n      such as <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">LAG()</span> and <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">FIRST_VALUE()</span>.\n    </p><p>\n      Analytic functions are frequently used in fields such as finance and science to provide trend, outlier, and\n      bucketed analysis for large data sets. You might also see the term <q>window functions</q> in database\n      literature, referring to the sequence of rows (the <q>window</q>) that the function call applies to,\n      particularly when the <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">OVER</span> clause includes a <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">ROWS</span> or <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">RANGE</span>\n      keyword.\n    </p><p>\n      The following sections describe the analytic query clauses and the pure analytic functions provided by\n      Impala.

It divides the rows into groups containing identical values in one or more\n        columns. These logical groups are known as <span class=\"hue-doc-term\">partitions</span>. Throughout the discussion of analytic\n        functions, <q>partitions</q> refers to the groups produced by the <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">PARTITION BY</span> clause, not\n        to partitioned tables. However, note the following limitation that applies specifically to analytic function\n        calls involving partitioned tables.\n      </p><p id=\"analytic_partition_pruning_caveat\">\n        In queries involving both analytic functions and partitioned tables, partition pruning only occurs for columns named in the <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">PARTITION BY</span>\n        clause of the analytic function call. For example, if an analytic function query has a clause such as <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">WHERE year=2016</span>,\n        the way to make the query prune all other <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">YEAR</span> partitions is to include <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">PARTITION BY year</span> in the analytic function call;\n        for example, <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">OVER (PARTITION BY year,<span class=\"hue-doc-varname\">other_columns</span><span class=\"hue-doc-varname\">other_analytic_clauses</span>)</span>.\n</p><p>\n        The sequence of results from an analytic function <q>resets</q> for each new partition in the result set.\n        That is, the set of preceding or following rows considered by the analytic function always come from a\n        single partition. Any <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">MAX()</span>, <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">SUM()</span>, <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">ROW_NUMBER()</span>, and so\n        on apply to each partition independently. Omit the <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">PARTITION BY</span> clause to apply the\n        analytic operation to all the rows in the table.\n      </p><p><b>ORDER BY clause:</b></p><p>\n        The <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">ORDER BY</span> clause works much like the <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">ORDER BY</span> clause in the outermost\n        block of a query. It defines the order in which rows are evaluated for the entire input set, or for each\n        group produced by a <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">PARTITION BY</span> clause. You can order by one or multiple expressions, and\n        for each expression optionally choose ascending or descending order and whether nulls come first or last in\n        the sort order. Because this <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">ORDER BY</span> clause only defines the order in which rows are\n        evaluated, if you want the results to be output in a specific order, also include an <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">ORDER\n        BY</span> clause in the outer block of the query.\n      </p><p>\n        When the <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">ORDER BY</span> clause is omitted, the analytic function applies to all items in the\n        group produced by the <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">PARTITION BY</span> clause. When the <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">ORDER BY</span> clause is\n        included, the analysis can apply to all or a subset of the items in the group, depending on the optional\n        window clause.\n      </p><p>\n        The order in which the rows are analyzed is only defined for those columns specified in <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">ORDER\n        BY</span> clauses.\n      </p><p>\n        One difference between the analytic and outer uses of the <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">ORDER BY</span> clause: inside the\n        <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">OVER</span> clause, <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">ORDER BY 1</span> or other integer value is interpreted as a\n        constant sort value (effectively a no-op) rather than referring to column 1.\n      </p><p><b>Window clause:</b></p><p>\n        The window clause is only allowed in combination with an <span class=\"hue-doc-codeph\">ORDER BY</span> clause.
