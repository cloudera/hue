For the best experience, ensure any third-party product you intend to use is supported.\n      Verifying support includes checking that the versions of Impala, ODBC, the operating system, the\n      Apache Hadoop distribution, and the third-party product have all been approved by the appropriate suppliers\n      for use together. To configure your systems to use ODBC, download and install a connector, typically from\n      the supplier of the third-party product or the Hadoop distribution.\n      You may need to sign in and accept license agreements before accessing the pages required for downloading\n      ODBC connectors.\n    </p></div></div></div>","title":"Configuring Impala to Work with ODBC"}
