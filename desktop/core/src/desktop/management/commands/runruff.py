    Run Ruff code quality checks on Python files.

    This command runs Ruff on a set of Python files, either specified explicitly or
    determined by comparing the current branch with a specified diff branch.

    Options:
      --diff-branch=<branch>  Compare the current branch with the specified branch
                              and check only the files that have changed.
      All original Ruff commands are supported, including --fix to automatically fix errors.

    Examples:
      Run Ruff linting on specific Python files:
        ./build/env/bin/hue runruff check file1.py file2.py

      Run Ruff linting on files changed between the current branch and a specified diff branch:
        ./build/env/bin/hue runruff check --diff-branch=origin/master

      Automatically fix all Ruff errors on files changed between the current branch and a specified diff branch:
        ./build/env/bin/hue runruff check --diff-branch=origin/master --fix

    Note:
      Make sure to install Ruff first by running `./build/env/bin/pip install ruff` in your environment.
      This command passes all additional arguments to Ruff, so you can use any Ruff option or flag.
