dnspython
=========

Dnspython is a DNS toolkit for Python.  It can be used for queries,
zone transfers, dynamic updates, nameserver testing, and many other
things.

Dnspython provides both high and low level access to the DNS. The high
level classes perform queries for data of a given name, type, and
class, and return an answer set. The low level classes allow direct
manipulation of DNS zones, messages, names, and records.  Almost all
RR types are supported.

dnspython originated at Nominum where it was developed for testing DNS
nameservers. Nominum has generously allowed it to be open sourced
under a BSD-style license, and helps support its future development by
continuing to employ the author.
