        About
        =====
        
        Beaker is a web session and general caching library that includes WSGI
        middleware for use in web applications.
        
        As a general caching library, Beaker can handle storing for various times
        any Python object that can be pickled with optional back-ends on a
        fine-grained basis.
        
        Beaker was built largely on the code from MyghtyUtils, then refactored and
        extended with database support.
        
        Beaker includes Cache and Session WSGI middleware to ease integration with
        WSGI capable frameworks, and is automatically used by `Pylons
        <http://pylonshq.com/>`_.
        
        
        Features
        ========
        
        * Fast, robust performance
        * Multiple reader/single writer lock system to avoid duplicate simultaneous
        cache creation
        * Cache back-ends include dbm, file, memory, memcached, and database (Using
        SQLAlchemy for multiple-db vendor support)
        * Signed cookie's to prevent session hijacking/spoofing
        * Cookie-only sessions to remove the need for a db or file backend (ideal
        for clustered systems)
        * Extensible Container object to support new back-ends
        * Cache's can be divided into namespaces (to represent templates, objects,
        etc.) then keyed for different copies
        * Create functions for automatic call-backs to create new cache copies after
        expiration
        * Fine-grained toggling of back-ends, keys, and expiration per Cache object
