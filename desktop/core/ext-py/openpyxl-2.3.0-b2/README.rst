openpyxl
========

openpyxl is a Python library to read/write Excel 2010 xlsx/xlsm/xltx/xltm files.

It was born from lack of existing library to read/write natively from Python
the Office Open XML format.

All kudos to the PHPExcel team as openpyxl is based on PHPExcel

Sample code::

    from openpyxl import Workbook
    wb = Workbook()

    # grab the active worksheet
    ws = wb.active

    # Data can be assigned directly to cells
    ws['A1'] = 42

    # Rows can also be appended
    ws.append([1, 2, 3])

    # Python types will automatically be converted
    import datetime
    ws['A2'] = datetime.datetime.now()

    # Save the file
    wb.save("sample.xlsx")
