Version 2.4.2
-------------
- Updated zoneinfo to 2015b.
- Fixed issue with parsing of tzstr on Python 2.7.x; tzstr will now be decoded
  if not a unicode type. gh #51 (lp:1331576), gh pr #55.
- Fix a parser issue where AM and PM tokens were showing up in fuzzy date
  stamps, triggering inappropriate errors. gh #56 (lp: 1428895), gh pr #63.
- Missing function "setcachsize" removed from zoneinfo __all__ list by @ryanss,
  fixing an issue with wildcard imports of dateutil.zoneinfo. (gh pr #66).
- (PyPi only) Fix an issue with source distributions not including the test
  suite.


Version 2.4.1
-------------

- Added explicit check for valid hours if AM/PM is specified in parser.
  (gh pr #22, issue #21)
- Fix bug in rrule introduced in 2.4.0 where byweekday parameter was not
  handled properly. (gh pr #35, issue #34)
- Fix error where parser allowed some invalid dates, overwriting existing hours
  with the last 2-digit number in the string. (gh pr #32, issue #31)
- Fix and add test for Python 2.x compatibility with boolean checking of
  relativedelta objects. Implemented by @nimasmi (gh pr #43) and Cédric Krier 
  (lp: 1035038)
- Replaced parse() calls with explicit datetime objects in unit tests unrelated
  to parser. (gh pr #36)
- Changed private _byxxx from sets to sorted tuples and fixed one currently
  unreachable bug in _construct_byset. (gh pr #54)
- Additional documentation for parser (gh pr #29, #33, #41) and rrule.
- Formatting fixes to documentation of rrule and README.rst.
- Updated zoneinfo to 2015a.

Version 2.4.0
-------------

- Fix an issue with relativedelta and freezegun (lp:1374022)
- Fix tzinfo in windows for timezones without dst (lp:1010050, gh #2)
- Ignore missing timezones in windows like in POSIX
- Fix minimal version requirement for six (gh #6)
- Many rrule changes and fixes by @pganssle (gh pull requests #13 #14 #17),
    including defusing some infinite loops (gh #4)

Version 2.3
-----------

- Cleanup directory structure, moved test.py to dateutil/tests/test.py

- Changed many aspects of dealing with the zone info file. Instead of a cache,
  all the zones are loaded to memory, but symbolic links are loaded only once,
  so not much memory is used.

- The package is now zip-safe, and universal-wheelable, thanks to changes in 
  the handling of the zoneinfo file. 

- Fixed tzwin silently not imported on windows python2

- New maintainer, together with new hosting: GitHub, Travis, Read-The-Docs

Version 2.2
-----------

- Updated zoneinfo to 2013h

- fuzzy_with_tokens parse addon from Christopher Corley

- Bug with LANG=C fixed by Mike Gilbert

Version 2.1
-----------

- New maintainer

- Dateutil now works on Python 2.6, 2.7 and 3.2 from same codebase (with six)

- #704047: Ismael Carnales' patch for a new time format

- Small bug fixes, thanks for reporters!


Version 2.0
-----------

- Ported to Python 3, by Brian Jones.  If you need dateutil for Python 2.X,
  please continue using the 1.X series.

- There's no such thing as a "PSF License".  This source code is now
  made available under the Simplified BSD license.  See LICENSE for
  details.

Version 1.5
-----------

- As reported by Mathieu Bridon, rrules were matching the bysecond rules
  incorrectly against byminute in some circumstances when the SECONDLY
  frequency was in use, due to a copy & paste bug.  The problem has been
  unittested and corrected.

- Adam Ryan reported a problem in the relativedelta implementation which
  affected the yearday parameter in the month of January specifically.
  This has been unittested and fixed.

- Updated timezone information.


Version 1.4.1
-------------

- Updated timezone information.


Version 1.4
-----------

- Fixed another parser precision problem on conversion of decimal seconds
  to microseconds, as reported by Erik Brown.  Now these issues are gone
  for real since it's not using floating point arithmetic anymore.

- Fixed case where tzrange.utcoffset and tzrange.dst() might fail due
  to a date being used where a datetime was expected (reported and fixed
  by Lennart Regebro).

- Prevent tzstr from introducing daylight timings in strings that didn't
  specify them (reported by Lennart Regebro).

- Calls like gettz("GMT+3") and gettz("UTC-2") will now return the
  expected values, instead of the TZ variable behavior.

- Fixed DST signal handling in zoneinfo files.  Reported by
  Nicholas F. Fabry and John-Mark Gurney.


Version 1.3
-----------

- Fixed precision problem on conversion of decimal seconds to
  microseconds, as reported by Skip Montanaro.

- Fixed bug in constructor of parser, and converted parser classes to
  new-style classes.  Original report and patch by Michael Elsdörfer.

- Initialize tzid and comps in tz.py, to prevent the code from ever
  raising a NameError (even with broken files).  Johan Dahlin suggested
  the fix after a pyflakes run.

- Version is now published in dateutil.__version__, as requested
  by Darren Dale.

- All code is compatible with new-style division.


Version 1.2
-----------

- Now tzfile will round timezones to full-minutes if necessary,
  since Python's datetime doesn't support sub-minute offsets.
  Thanks to Ilpo Nyyssönen for reporting the issue.

- Removed bare string exceptions, as reported and fixed by
  Wilfredo Sánchez Vega.

- Fix bug in leap count parsing (reported and fixed by Eugene Oden).


Version 1.1
-----------

- Fixed rrule byyearday handling. Abramo Bagnara pointed out that
  RFC2445 allows negative numbers.

- Fixed --prefix handling in setup.py (by Sidnei da Silva).

- Now tz.gettz() returns a tzlocal instance when not given any
  arguments and no other timezone information is found.

- Updating timezone information to version 2005q.


Version 1.0
-----------

- Fixed parsing of XXhXXm formatted time after day/month/year
  has been parsed.

- Added patch by Jeffrey Harris optimizing rrule.__contains__.


Version 0.9
-----------

- Fixed pickling of timezone types, as reported by
  Andreas Köhler.

- Implemented internal timezone information with binary
  timezone files [1]. datautil.tz.gettz() function will now
  try to use the system timezone files, and fallback to
  the internal versions. It's also possible to ask for
  the internal versions directly by using
  dateutil.zoneinfo.gettz().

- New tzwin timezone type, allowing access to Windows
  internal timezones (contributed by Jeffrey Harris).

- Fixed parsing of unicode date strings.

- Accept parserinfo instances as the parser constructor
  parameter, besides parserinfo (sub)classes.

- Changed weekday to spell the not-set n value as None
  instead of 0.

- Fixed other reported bugs.

Version 0.5
-----------

- Removed FREQ_ prefix from rrule frequency constants
  WARNING: this breaks compatibility with previous versions.

- Fixed rrule.between() for cases where "after" is achieved
  before even starting, as reported by Andreas Köhler.

- Fixed two digit zero-year parsing (such as 31-Dec-00), as
  reported by Jim Abramson, and included test case for this.

- Sort exdate and rdate before iterating over them, so that
  it's not necessary to sort them before adding to the rruleset,
  as reported by Nicholas Piper.
