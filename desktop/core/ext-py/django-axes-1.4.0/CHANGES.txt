1.3.7 (2014-10-05)
------------------

- Explain common issues where Axes fails silently
  [cericoda]

- Allow for user-defined username field for lookup in POST data
  [SteveByerly]

- Log out only if user was logged in
  [zoten]

- Support for floats in cooloff time (i.e: 0.1 == 6 minutes)
  [marianov]

- Limit amount of POST data logged (#73). Limiting the length of value is not enough, as there could be arbitrary number of them, or very long key names.
  [peterkuma]

- Improve get_ip to try for real ip address
  [7wonders]

- Change IPAddressField to GenericIPAddressField. When using a PostgreSQL database and the client does not pass an IP address you get an inet error. This is a known problem with PostgreSQL and the IPAddressField. https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/5622. It can be fixed by using a GenericIPAddressField instead.
  [polvoblanco]

- Get first X-Forwarded-For IP
  [tutumcloud]

- White listing IP addresses behind reverse proxy. Allowing some IP addresses to have direct access to the app even if they are behind a reverse proxy. Those IP addresses must still be on a white list.
  [ericbulloch]

- Reduce logging of reverse proxy IP lookup and use configured logger. Fixes #76. Instead of logging the notice that django.axes looks for a HTTP header set by a reverse proxy on each attempt, just log it one-time on first module import. Also use the configured logger (by default axes.watch_login) for the message to be more consistent in logging.
