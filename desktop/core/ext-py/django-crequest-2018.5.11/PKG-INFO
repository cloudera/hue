        How to use
        ==========
        
        First import the crequest's middleware::
        
            from crequest.middleware import CrequestMiddleware
        
        Get the current ``request`` ;)::
        
            current_request = CrequestMiddleware.get_request()
        
        Done.
        
        In depth & Complex details
        ==========================
        
        Set the current request in UnKnown situations::
        
             CrequestMiddleware.set_request(request)
        
        Return *iam_request* if there is no current request::
        
            CrequestMiddleware.get_request(iam_request)
        
        And finally delete::
        
            CrequestMiddleware.del_request()
        
        The middleware automatically sets/deletes the current request for HTTP requests.
        For other uses (management commands, scripts), you will need to do this yourself.
