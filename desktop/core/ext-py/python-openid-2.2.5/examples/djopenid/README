DJANGO EXAMPLE PACKAGE
======================

This package implements an example consumer and server for the Django
Python web framework.  You can get Django (and learn more about it) at

  http://www.djangoproject.com/

SETUP
=====

 1. Install the OpenID library, version 2.0.0 or later.

 2. Install Django 0.95.1.

    If you find that the examples run on even newer versions of
    Django, please let us know!

 3. Modify djopenid/settings.py appropriately; you may wish to change
    the database type or path, although the default settings should be
    sufficient for most systems.

 4. In examples/djopenid/ run:

    python manage.py syncdb

 5. To run the example consumer or server, run

    python manage.py runserver PORT

    where PORT is the port number on which to listen.

    Note that if you want to try both the consumer and server at the
    same time, run the command twice with two different values for
    PORT.

 6. Point your web browser at the server at

    http://localhost:PORT/

    to begin.

ABOUT THE CODE
==============

The example server and consumer code provided in this package are
intended to be instructional in the use of this OpenID library.  While
it is not recommended to use the example code in production, the code
should be sufficient to explain the general use of the library.

If you aren't familiar with the Django web framework, you can quickly
start looking at the important code by looking in the 'views' modules:

  djopenid.consumer.views
  djopenid.server.views

Each view is a python callable that responds to an HTTP request.
Regardless of whether you use a framework, your application should
look similar to these example applications.
