    <p>
    This is a Django package which implements both an OpenID server
    and an OpenID consumer.  These examples are provided with the
    OpenID library so you can learn how to use it in your own
    applications.

    <ul>
      <li><a href="{{ consumer_url }}">Example Consumer (Relying Party)</a></li>
      <li><a href="{{ server_url }}">Example Server (Identity Provider)</a></li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    <strong>Note:</strong> If you want to test the example consumer
    using the example server, you must start a separate server process
    for each application.
