v1.2 - 2014-04-10
-----------------

- django-auth-ldap now provides experimental Python 3 support. Python 2.5 was
  dropped.

  To sum up, django-auth-ldap works with Python 2.6, 2.7, 3.3 and 3.4.

  Since python-ldap isn't making progress toward Python 3, if you're using
  Python 3, you need to install a fork::

      $ pip install git+https://github.com/rbarrois/python-ldap.git@py3

  Thanks to `Aymeric Augustin <https://myks.org/en/>`_ for making this happen.


v1.1.8 - 2014-02-01
-------------------

* Fix `#43`_: Update :class:`~django_auth_ldap.config.LDAPSearchUnion` to work for
  group searches in addition to user searches.

* Tox no longer supports Python 2.5, so our tests now run on 2.6 and 2.7 only.

v1.1.7 - 2013-11-19
-------------------

* Bug fix: :setting:`AUTH_LDAP_GLOBAL_OPTIONS` could be ignored in some cases
  (such as :func:`~django_auth_ldap.backend.LDAPBackend.populate_user`).


v1.1.5 - 2013-10-25
-------------------

* Fix `#41`_: Support POSIX group permissions with no gidNumber attribute.

* Support multiple group DNs for \*_FLAGS_BY_GROUP.


.. _#41: https://bitbucket.org/psagers/django-auth-ldap/issue/41/


v1.1.4 - 2013-03-09
-------------------

* Add support for Django 1.5's custom user models.


v1.1.3 - 2013-01-05
-------------------

* Fix `#33`_: Reject empty passwords by default.

  Unless :setting:`AUTH_LDAP_PERMIT_EMPTY_PASSWORD` is set to True,
  LDAPBackend.authenticate() will immediately return None if the password is
  empty. This is technically backwards-incompatible, but it's a more secure
  default for those LDAP servers that are configured such that binds without
  passwords always succeed.

* Fix `#39`_: Add support for pickling LDAP-authenticated users.
