"""Team membership support for Launchpad.

The primary form of communication between the RP and Launchpad is an
OpenID authentication request. Our solution is to piggyback a team
membership test onto this interaction.

As part of an OpenID authentication request, the RP includes the
following fields:

  openid.ns.lp:
    An OpenID 2.0 namespace URI for the extension. It is not strictly
    required for 1.1 requests, but including it is good for forward
    compatibility.

    It must be set to: http://ns.launchpad.net/2007/openid-teams

  openid.lp.query_membership:
    A comma separated list of Launchpad team names that the RP is
    interested in.

As part of the positive assertion OpenID response, the following field
will be provided:

  openid.ns.lp:
    (as above)

  openid.lp.is_member:
    A comma separated list of teams that the user is actually a member
    of. The list may be limited to those teams mentioned in the
    request.

    This field must be included in the response signature in order to
    be considered valid (as the response is bounced through the user's
    web browser, an unsigned value could be modified).
