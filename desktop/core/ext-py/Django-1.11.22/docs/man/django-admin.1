.sp
\fBdjango\-admin\fP is Django\(aqs command\-line utility for administrative tasks.
This document outlines all it can do.
.sp
In addition, \fBmanage.py\fP is automatically created in each Django project.
\fBmanage.py\fP does the same thing as \fBdjango\-admin\fP but takes care of a few
things for you:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
It puts your project\(aqs package on \fBsys.path\fP\&.
.IP \(bu 2
It sets the \fBDJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE\fP environment variable so that
it points to your project\(aqs \fBsettings.py\fP file.
.UNINDENT
.sp
The \fBdjango\-admin\fP script should be on your system path if you installed
Django via its \fBsetup.py\fP utility. If it\(aqs not on your path, you can find it
in \fBsite\-packages/django/bin\fP within your Python installation. Consider
symlinking it from some place on your path, such as \fB/usr/local/bin\fP\&.
.sp
For Windows users, who do not have symlinking functionality available, you can
copy \fBdjango\-admin.exe\fP to a location on your existing path or edit the
\fBPATH\fP settings (under \fBSettings \- Control Panel \- System \- Advanced \-
Environment...\fP) to point to its installed location.
.sp
Generally, when working on a single Django project, it\(aqs easier to use
\fBmanage.py\fP than \fBdjango\-admin\fP\&. If you need to switch between multiple
Django settings files, use \fBdjango\-admin\fP with
\fBDJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE\fP or the \fI\%\-\-settings\fP command line
option.
.sp
The command\-line examples throughout this document use \fBdjango\-admin\fP to
be consistent, but any example can use \fBmanage.py\fP or \fBpython \-m django\fP
just as well.
.SH USAGE
.INDENT 0.0

.sp
\fBcommand\fP should be one of the commands listed in this document.
\fBoptions\fP, which is optional, should be zero or more of the options available
for the given command.
.SS Getting runtime help
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B django\-admin help
.UNINDENT
.sp
Run \fBdjango\-admin help\fP to display usage information and a list of the
commands provided by each application.
.sp
Run \fBdjango\-admin help \-\-commands\fP to display a list of all available
commands.
.sp
Run \fBdjango\-admin help <command>\fP to display a description of the given
command and a list of its available options.
.SS App names
.sp
Many commands take a list of "app names." An "app name" is the basename of
the package containing your models. For example, if your \fBINSTALLED_APPS\fP
contains the string \fB\(aqmysite.blog\(aq\fP, the app name is \fBblog\fP\&.
.SS Determining the version
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B django\-admin version
.UNINDENT
.sp
Run \fBdjango\-admin version\fP to display the current Django version.
.sp
The output follows the schema described in \fI\%PEP 440\fP:

information that \fBdjango\-admin\fP prints to the console.
.SH AVAILABLE COMMANDS
.SS \fBcheck\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B django\-admin check [app_label [app_label ...]]
.UNINDENT
.sp
Uses the system check framework to inspect the entire
Django project for common problems.
.sp
By default, all apps will be checked. You can check a subset of apps by
providing a list of app labels as arguments:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
django\-admin check auth admin myapp
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
If you do not specify any app, all apps will be checked.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-tag TAGS, \-t TAGS
.UNINDENT
.sp
The system check framework performs many different types of checks that are
categorized with tags\&. You can use these
tags to restrict the checks performed to just those in a particular category.
For example, to perform only models and compatibility checks, run:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
django\-admin check \-\-tag models \-\-tag compatibility
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-list\-tags
.UNINDENT
.sp
Lists all available tags.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-deploy
.UNINDENT
.sp
Activates some additional checks that are only relevant in a deployment setting.
.sp
You can use this option in your local development environment, but since your
local development settings module may not have many of your production settings,
you will probably want to point the \fBcheck\fP command at a different settings
module, either by setting the \fBDJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE\fP environment variable,
or by passing the \fB\-\-settings\fP option:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
django\-admin check \-\-deploy \-\-settings=production_settings
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Or you could run it directly on a production or staging deployment to verify
that the correct settings are in use (omitting \fB\-\-settings\fP). You could even
make it part of your integration test suite.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-fail\-level {CRITICAL,ERROR,WARNING,INFO,DEBUG}

.SS \fBcreatecachetable\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B django\-admin createcachetable
.UNINDENT
.sp
Creates the cache tables for use with the database cache backend using the
information from your settings file. See /topics/cache for more
information.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-database DATABASE
.UNINDENT
.sp
Specifies the database in which the cache table(s) will be created. Defaults to
\fBdefault\fP\&.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-dry\-run
.UNINDENT
.sp
Prints the SQL that would be run without actually running it, so you can
customize it or use the migrations framework.
.SS \fBdbshell\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B django\-admin dbshell
.UNINDENT
.sp
Runs the command\-line client for the database engine specified in your
\fBENGINE\fP setting, with the connection parameters
specified in your \fBUSER\fP, \fBPASSWORD\fP, etc., settings.
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
For PostgreSQL, this runs the \fBpsql\fP command\-line client.
.IP \(bu 2
For MySQL, this runs the \fBmysql\fP command\-line client.
.IP \(bu 2
For SQLite, this runs the \fBsqlite3\fP command\-line client.
.IP \(bu 2
For Oracle, this runs the \fBsqlplus\fP command\-line client.
.UNINDENT
.sp
This command assumes the programs are on your \fBPATH\fP so that a simple call to
the program name (\fBpsql\fP, \fBmysql\fP, \fBsqlite3\fP, \fBsqlplus\fP) will find the
program in the right place. There\(aqs no way to specify the location of the
program manually.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-database DATABASE
.UNINDENT
.sp
Specifies the database onto which to open a shell. Defaults to \fBdefault\fP\&.
.SS \fBdiffsettings\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B django\-admin diffsettings
.UNINDENT
.sp
Displays differences between the current settings file and Django\(aqs default
settings (or another settings file specified by \fI\%\-\-default\fP).
.sp
Settings that don\(aqt appear in the defaults are followed by \fB"###"\fP\&. For
example, the default settings don\(aqt define \fBROOT_URLCONF\fP, so
\fBROOT_URLCONF\fP is followed by \fB"###"\fP in the output of
\fBdiffsettings\fP\&.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-all
.UNINDENT
.sp
Displays all settings, even if they have Django\(aqs default value. Such settings
are prefixed by \fB"###"\fP\&.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-default MODULE
.UNINDENT
.sp

.sp
The settings module to compare the current settings against. Leave empty to
compare against Django\(aqs default settings.
.SS \fBdumpdata\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B django\-admin dumpdata [app_label[.ModelName] [app_label[.ModelName] ...]]
.UNINDENT
.sp
Outputs to standard output all data in the database associated with the named
application(s).
.sp
If no application name is provided, all installed applications will be dumped.
.sp
The output of \fBdumpdata\fP can be used as input for \fI\%loaddata\fP\&.
.sp
Note that \fBdumpdata\fP uses the default manager on the model for selecting the
records to dump. If you\(aqre using a custom manager as
the default manager and it filters some of the available records, not all of the
objects will be dumped.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-all, \-a
.UNINDENT
.sp
Uses Django\(aqs base manager, dumping records which might otherwise be filtered
or modified by a custom manager.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-format FORMAT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Specifies the serialization format of the output. Defaults to JSON. Supported
formats are listed in serialization\-formats\&.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-indent INDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Specifies the number of indentation spaces to use in the output. Defaults to
\fBNone\fP which displays all data on single line.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-exclude EXCLUDE, \-e EXCLUDE
.UNINDENT
.sp
Prevents specific applications or models (specified in the form of
\fBapp_label.ModelName\fP) from being dumped. If you specify a model name, the
output will be restricted to that model, rather than the entire application.
You can also mix application names and model names.
.sp
If you want to exclude multiple applications, pass \fB\-\-exclude\fP more than
once:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
django\-admin dumpdata \-\-exclude=auth \-\-exclude=contenttypes
.ft P

.UNINDENT
.sp
Specifies the database from which data will be dumped. Defaults to \fBdefault\fP\&.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-natural\-foreign
.UNINDENT
.sp
Uses the \fBnatural_key()\fP model method to serialize any foreign key and
many\-to\-many relationship to objects of the type that defines the method. If
you\(aqre dumping \fBcontrib.auth\fP \fBPermission\fP objects or
\fBcontrib.contenttypes\fP \fBContentType\fP objects, you should probably use this
flag. See the natural keys
documentation for more details on this and the next option.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-natural\-primary
.UNINDENT
.sp
Omits the primary key in the serialized data of this object since it can be
calculated during deserialization.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-pks PRIMARY_KEYS
.UNINDENT
.sp
Outputs only the objects specified by a comma separated list of primary keys.
This is only available when dumping one model. By default, all the records of
the model are output.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-output OUTPUT, \-o OUTPUT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Specifies a file to write the serialized data to. By default, the data goes to
standard output.
.sp
When this option is set and \fB\-\-verbosity\fP is greater than 0 (the default), a
progress bar is shown in the terminal.
.SS \fBflush\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B django\-admin flush
.UNINDENT
.sp
Removes all data from the database and re\-executes any post\-synchronization
handlers. The table of which migrations have been applied is not cleared.
.sp
If you would rather start from an empty database and re\-run all migrations, you
should drop and recreate the database and then run \fI\%migrate\fP instead.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-noinput, \-\-no\-input
.UNINDENT
.sp
Suppresses all user prompts.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-database DATABASE
.UNINDENT
.sp
Specifies the database to flush. Defaults to \fBdefault\fP\&.
.SS \fBinspectdb\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B django\-admin inspectdb [table [table ...]]
.UNINDENT
.sp
Introspects the database tables in the database pointed\-to by the
\fBNAME\fP setting and outputs a Django model module (a \fBmodels.py\fP
file) to standard output. You may choose what tables to inspect by passing
their names as arguments.
.sp
Use this if you have a legacy database with which you\(aqd like to use Django.
The script will inspect the database and create a model for each table within
it.
.sp
As you might expect, the created models will have an attribute for every field
in the table. Note that \fBinspectdb\fP has a few special cases in its field\-name
output:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
If \fBinspectdb\fP cannot map a column\(aqs type to a model field type, it\(aqll
use \fBTextField\fP and will insert the Python comment
\fB\(aqThis field type is a guess.\(aq\fP next to the field in the generated
model.
.IP \(bu 2
If the database column name is a Python reserved word (such as
\fB\(aqpass\(aq\fP, \fB\(aqclass\(aq\fP or \fB\(aqfor\(aq\fP), \fBinspectdb\fP will append
\fB\(aq_field\(aq\fP to the attribute name. For example, if a table has a column
\fB\(aqfor\(aq\fP, the generated model will have a field \fB\(aqfor_field\(aq\fP, with
the \fBdb_column\fP attribute set to \fB\(aqfor\(aq\fP\&. \fBinspectdb\fP will insert
the Python comment
\fB\(aqField renamed because it was a Python reserved word.\(aq\fP next to the
field.
.UNINDENT
.sp
This feature is meant as a shortcut, not as definitive model generation. After
you run it, you\(aqll want to look over the generated models yourself to make
customizations. In particular, you\(aqll need to rearrange models\(aq order, so that
models that refer to other models are ordered properly.
.sp
Primary keys are automatically introspected for PostgreSQL, MySQL and
SQLite, in which case Django puts in the \fBprimary_key=True\fP where
needed.
.sp
\fBinspectdb\fP works with PostgreSQL, MySQL and SQLite. Foreign\-key detection
only works in PostgreSQL and with certain types of MySQL tables.
.sp
Django doesn\(aqt create database defaults when a
\fBdefault\fP is specified on a model field.
Similarly, database defaults aren\(aqt translated to model field defaults or
detected in any fashion by \fBinspectdb\fP\&.
.sp
By default, \fBinspectdb\fP creates unmanaged models. That is, \fBmanaged = False\fP
in the model\(aqs \fBMeta\fP class tells Django not to manage each table\(aqs creation,
modification, and deletion. If you do want to allow Django to manage the
table\(aqs lifecycle, you\(aqll need to change the
\fBmanaged\fP option to \fBTrue\fP (or simply remove
it because \fBTrue\fP is its default value).
.sp
Support for the \fBtable\fP argument(s) to choose what tables should be
inspected was added.

.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-database DATABASE
.UNINDENT
.sp
Specifies the database to introspect. Defaults to \fBdefault\fP\&.
.SS \fBloaddata\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B django\-admin loaddata fixture [fixture ...]
.UNINDENT
.sp
Searches for and loads the contents of the named fixture into the database.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-database DATABASE
.UNINDENT
.sp
Specifies the database into which the data will be loaded. Defaults to
\fBdefault\fP\&.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-ignorenonexistent, \-i
.UNINDENT
.sp
Ignores fields and models that may have been removed since the fixture was
originally generated.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-app APP_LABEL
.UNINDENT
.sp
Specifies a single app to look for fixtures in rather than looking in all apps.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-exclude EXCLUDE, \-e EXCLUDE
.UNINDENT
.sp

.sp
Excludes loading the fixtures from the given applications and/or models (in the
form of \fBapp_label\fP or \fBapp_label.ModelName\fP). Use the option multiple
times to exclude more than one app or model.
.SS What\(aqs a "fixture"?
.sp
A \fIfixture\fP is a collection of files that contain the serialized contents of
the database. Each fixture has a unique name, and the files that comprise the
fixture can be distributed over multiple directories, in multiple applications.
.sp
Django will search in three locations for fixtures:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP 1. 3
In the \fBfixtures\fP directory of every installed application
.IP 2. 3
In any directory named in the \fBFIXTURE_DIRS\fP setting
.IP 3. 3
In the literal path named by the fixture
.UNINDENT
.sp
Django will load any and all fixtures it finds in these locations that match
the provided fixture names.
.sp
If the named fixture has a file extension, only fixtures of that type
will be loaded. For example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
django\-admin loaddata mydata.json
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
would only load JSON fixtures called \fBmydata\fP\&. The fixture extension
must correspond to the registered name of a
serializer (e.g., \fBjson\fP or \fBxml\fP).
.sp
If you omit the extensions, Django will search all available fixture types
for a matching fixture. For example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
django\-admin loaddata mydata
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
would look for any fixture of any fixture type called \fBmydata\fP\&. If a fixture
directory contained \fBmydata.json\fP, that fixture would be loaded
as a JSON fixture.
.sp
The fixtures that are named can include directory components. These
directories will be included in the search path. For example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
django\-admin loaddata foo/bar/mydata.json
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
would search \fB<app_label>/fixtures/foo/bar/mydata.json\fP for each installed
application,  \fB<dirname>/foo/bar/mydata.json\fP for each directory in
\fBFIXTURE_DIRS\fP, and the literal path \fBfoo/bar/mydata.json\fP\&.
.sp
When fixture files are processed, the data is saved to the database as is.
Model defined \fBsave()\fP methods are not called, and
any \fBpre_save\fP or
\fBpost_save\fP signals will be called with
\fBraw=True\fP since the instance only contains attributes that are local to the
model. You may, for example, want to disable handlers that access
related fields that aren\(aqt present during fixture loading and would otherwise
raise an exception:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
from django.db.models.signals import post_save
from .models import MyModel

def my_handler(**kwargs):
    # disable the handler during fixture loading
    if kwargs[\(aqraw\(aq]:
        return
    ...

post_save.connect(my_handler, sender=MyModel)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
You could also write a simple decorator to encapsulate this logic:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
from functools import wraps

def disable_for_loaddata(signal_handler):
    """
    Decorator that turns off signal handlers when loading fixture data.
    """
    @wraps(signal_handler)
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        if kwargs[\(aqraw\(aq]:
            return
        signal_handler(*args, **kwargs)
    return wrapper

@disable_for_loaddata
def my_handler(**kwargs):
    ...
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Just be aware that this logic will disable the signals whenever fixtures are
deserialized, not just during \fBloaddata\fP\&.
.sp
Note that the order in which fixture files are processed is undefined. However,
all fixture data is installed as a single transaction, so data in
one fixture can reference data in another fixture. If the database backend
supports row\-level constraints, these constraints will be checked at the
end of the transaction.
.sp
The \fI\%dumpdata\fP command can be used to generate input for \fBloaddata\fP\&.
.SS Compressed fixtures
.sp
Fixtures may be compressed in \fBzip\fP, \fBgz\fP, or \fBbz2\fP format. For example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
django\-admin loaddata mydata.json
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
would look for any of \fBmydata.json\fP, \fBmydata.json.zip\fP,
\fBmydata.json.gz\fP, or \fBmydata.json.bz2\fP\&. The first file contained within a
zip\-compressed archive is used.
.sp
Note that if two fixtures with the same name but different
fixture type are discovered (for example, if \fBmydata.json\fP and
\fBmydata.xml.gz\fP were found in the same fixture directory), fixture
installation will be aborted, and any data installed in the call to
\fBloaddata\fP will be removed from the database.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.IP "MySQL with MyISAM and fixtures"
.sp
The MyISAM storage engine of MySQL doesn\(aqt support transactions or
constraints, so if you use MyISAM, you won\(aqt get validation of fixture
data, or a rollback if multiple transaction files are found.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Database\-specific fixtures
.sp
If you\(aqre in a multi\-database setup, you might have fixture data that
you want to load onto one database, but not onto another. In this
situation, you can add a database identifier into the names of your fixtures.
.sp
For example, if your \fBDATABASES\fP setting has a \(aqmaster\(aq database
defined, name the fixture \fBmydata.master.json\fP or
\fBmydata.master.json.gz\fP and the fixture will only be loaded when you
specify you want to load data into the \fBmaster\fP database.
.SS \fBmakemessages\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B django\-admin makemessages
.UNINDENT
.sp
Runs over the entire source tree of the current directory and pulls out all
strings marked for translation. It creates (or updates) a message file in the
conf/locale (in the Django tree) or locale (for project and application)
directory. After making changes to the messages files you need to compile them
with \fI\%compilemessages\fP for use with the builtin gettext support. See
the i18n documentation for details.
.sp
This command doesn\(aqt require configured settings. However, when settings aren\(aqt
configured, the command can\(aqt ignore the \fBMEDIA_ROOT\fP and
\fBSTATIC_ROOT\fP directories or include \fBLOCALE_PATHS\fP\&. It will
also write files in UTF\-8 rather than in \fBFILE_CHARSET\fP\&.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-all, \-a
.UNINDENT
.sp
Updates the message files for all available languages.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-extension EXTENSIONS, \-e EXTENSIONS
.UNINDENT
.sp
Specifies a list of file extensions to examine (default: \fBhtml\fP, \fBtxt\fP,

Synchronizes the database state with the current set of models and migrations.
Migrations, their relationship with apps and more are covered in depth in

.sp
The behavior of this command changes depending on the arguments provided:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
No arguments: All apps have all of their migrations run.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB<app_label>\fP: The specified app has its migrations run, up to the most
recent migration. This may involve running other apps\(aq migrations too, due
to dependencies.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB<app_label> <migrationname>\fP: Brings the database schema to a state where
the named migration is applied, but no later migrations in the same app are
applied. This may involve unapplying migrations if you have previously
migrated past the named migration. Use the name \fBzero\fP to unapply all
migrations for an app.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0

.UNINDENT
.sp
Specifies the database to migrate. Defaults to \fBdefault\fP\&.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-fake
.UNINDENT
.sp
Tells Django to mark the migrations as having been applied or unapplied, but
without actually running the SQL to change your database schema.
.sp
This is intended for advanced users to manipulate the
current migration state directly if they\(aqre manually applying changes;
be warned that using \fB\-\-fake\fP runs the risk of putting the migration state
table into a state where manual recovery will be needed to make migrations
run correctly.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-fake\-initial
.UNINDENT
.sp
Allows Django to skip an app\(aqs initial migration if all database tables with
the names of all models created by all
\fBCreateModel\fP operations in that
migration already exist. This option is intended for use when first running
migrations against a database that preexisted the use of migrations. This
option does not, however, check for matching database schema beyond matching
table names and so is only safe to use if you are confident that your existing
schema matches what is recorded in your initial migration.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-run\-syncdb
.UNINDENT

with hundreds of models.
.INDENT 0.0

.SS \fBrunserver\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B django\-admin runserver [addrport]
.UNINDENT
.sp
Starts a lightweight development Web server on the local machine. By default,
the server runs on port 8000 on the IP address \fB127.0.0.1\fP\&. You can pass in an
IP address and port number explicitly.
.sp
If you run this script as a user with normal privileges (recommended), you
might not have access to start a port on a low port number. Low port numbers
are reserved for the superuser (root).
.sp
This server uses the WSGI application object specified by the
\fBWSGI_APPLICATION\fP setting.
.sp
DO NOT USE THIS SERVER IN A PRODUCTION SETTING. It has not gone through
security audits or performance tests. (And that\(aqs how it\(aqs gonna stay. We\(aqre in
the business of making Web frameworks, not Web servers, so improving this
server to be able to handle a production environment is outside the scope of
Django.)
.sp
The development server automatically reloads Python code for each request, as
needed. You don\(aqt need to restart the server for code changes to take effect.
However, some actions like adding files don\(aqt trigger a restart, so you\(aqll
have to restart the server in these cases.
.sp
If you are using Linux and install \fI\%pyinotify\fP, kernel signals will be used to
autoreload the server (rather than polling file modification timestamps each
second). This offers better scaling to large projects, reduction in response
time to code modification, more robust change detection, and battery usage
reduction.
.sp
When you start the server, and each time you change Python code while the
server is running, the system check framework will check your entire Django
project for some common errors (see the \fI\%check\fP command). If any
errors are found, they will be printed to standard output.
.sp
You can run as many concurrent servers as you want, as long as they\(aqre on
separate ports. Just execute \fBdjango\-admin runserver\fP more than once.
.sp
Note that the default IP address, \fB127.0.0.1\fP, is not accessible from other
machines on your network. To make your development server viewable to other
machines on the network, use its own IP address (e.g. \fB192.168.2.1\fP) or
\fB0.0.0.0\fP or \fB::\fP (with IPv6 enabled).
.sp
You can provide an IPv6 address surrounded by brackets
(e.g. \fB[200a::1]:8000\fP). This will automatically enable IPv6 support.
.sp
A hostname containing ASCII\-only characters can also be used.
.sp
If the staticfiles contrib app is enabled
(default in new projects) the \fI\%runserver\fP command will be overridden
with its own runserver command.
.sp
If \fI\%migrate\fP was not previously executed, the table that stores the
history of migrations is created at first run of \fBrunserver\fP\&.
.sp
Logging of each request and response of the server is sent to the
django\-server\-logger logger.
.sp
In older versions, log messages were written to \fBsys.stderr\fP instead of
being handled through Python logging.

.INDENT 0.0

.B \-\-noreload
.UNINDENT

.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
When the app template files are rendered with the Django template
engine (by default all \fB*.py\fP files), Django will also replace all
stray template variables contained. For example, if one of the Python files
contains a docstring explaining a particular feature related
to template rendering, it might result in an incorrect example.
.sp
To work around this problem, you can use the \fBtemplatetag\fP
templatetag to "escape" the various parts of the template syntax.
.sp
In addition, to allow Python template files that contain Django template
language syntax while also preventing packaging systems from trying to
byte\-compile invalid \fB*.py\fP files, template files ending with \fB\&.py\-tpl\fP
will be renamed to \fB\&.py\fP\&.

.B django\-admin startproject name [directory]
.UNINDENT
.sp
Creates a Django project directory structure for the given project name in
the current directory or the given destination.
.sp
By default, the new directory contains \fBmanage.py\fP and a project package
(containing a \fBsettings.py\fP and other files). See the \fI\%template source\fP for
details.
.sp
If only the project name is given, both the project directory and project
package will be named \fB<projectname>\fP and the project directory
will be created in the current working directory.
.sp
If the optional destination is provided, Django will use that existing
directory as the project directory, and create \fBmanage.py\fP and the project
package within it. Use \(aq.\(aq to denote the current working directory.

.B \-\-parallel [N]
.UNINDENT
.sp
Runs tests in separate parallel processes. Since modern processors have
multiple cores, this allows running tests significantly faster.
.sp
By default \fB\-\-parallel\fP runs one process per core according to
\fI\%multiprocessing.cpu_count()\fP\&. You can adjust the number of processes
either by providing it as the option\(aqs value, e.g. \fB\-\-parallel=4\fP, or by
setting the \fBDJANGO_TEST_PROCESSES\fP environment variable.
.sp
Django distributes test cases — \fI\%unittest.TestCase\fP subclasses — to
subprocesses. If there are fewer test cases than configured processes, Django
will reduce the number of processes accordingly.
.sp
Each process gets its own database. You must ensure that different test cases
don\(aqt access the same resources. For instance, test cases that touch the
filesystem should create a temporary directory for their own use.
.sp
This option requires the third\-party \fBtblib\fP package to display tracebacks

.sp
If you want to use \fI\%pdb\fP while debugging tests, you must disable parallel
execution (\fB\-\-parallel=1\fP). You\(aqll see something like \fBbdb.BdbQuit\fP if you
don\(aqt.
.sp
\fBWARNING:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
When test parallelization is enabled and a test fails, Django may be
unable to display the exception traceback. This can make debugging
difficult. If you encounter this problem, run the affected test without
parallelization to see the traceback of the failure.
.sp
This is a known limitation. It arises from the need to serialize objects
in order to exchange them between processes. See

the views in a Web browser, manually.
.IP \(bu 2
Let\(aqs say you\(aqre developing your Django application and have a "pristine"
copy of a database that you\(aqd like to interact with. You can dump your
database to a fixture (using the \fI\%dumpdata\fP command, explained
above), then use \fBtestserver\fP to run your Web application with that data.
With this arrangement, you have the flexibility of messing up your data
in any way, knowing that whatever data changes you\(aqre making are only
being made to a test database.
.UNINDENT

.SS Syntax coloring
.sp
The \fBdjango\-admin\fP / \fBmanage.py\fP commands will use pretty
color\-coded output if your terminal supports ANSI\-colored output. It
won\(aqt use the color codes if you\(aqre piping the command\(aqs output to
another program.
.sp
Under Windows, the native console doesn\(aqt support ANSI escape sequences so by
default there is no color output. But you can install the \fI\%ANSICON\fP
third\-party tool, the Django commands will detect its presence and will make
use of its services to color output just like on Unix\-based platforms.
.sp
The colors used for syntax highlighting can be customized. Django
ships with three color palettes:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBdark\fP, suited to terminals that show white text on a black
background. This is the default palette.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBlight\fP, suited to terminals that show black text on a white
background.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBnocolor\fP, which disables syntax highlighting.
.UNINDENT
.sp
You select a palette by setting a \fBDJANGO_COLORS\fP environment
variable to specify the palette you want to use. For example, to
specify the \fBlight\fP palette under a Unix or OS/X BASH shell, you
would run the following at a command prompt:

.UNINDENT
.sp
where \fBrole\fP is the name of a valid color role, \fBfg\fP is the
foreground color, \fBbg\fP is the background color and each \fBoption\fP
is one of the color modifying options. Multiple color specifications
are then separated by a semicolon. For example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
export DJANGO_COLORS="error=yellow/blue,blink;notice=magenta"
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
would specify that errors be displayed using blinking yellow on blue,
and notices displayed using magenta. All other color roles would be
left uncolored.
.sp
Colors can also be specified by extending a base palette. If you put
a palette name in a color specification, all the colors implied by that
palette will be loaded. So:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
export DJANGO_COLORS="light;error=yellow/blue,blink;notice=magenta"
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT

.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
# Similar to the command line
management.call_command(\(aqdumpdata\(aq, \(aq\-\-natural\-foreign\(aq)

# Named argument similar to the command line minus the initial dashes and
# with internal dashes replaced by underscores
management.call_command(\(aqdumpdata\(aq, natural_foreign=True)

# \(gause_natural_foreign_keys\(ga is the option destination variable
management.call_command(\(aqdumpdata\(aq, use_natural_foreign_keys=True)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Some command options have different names when using \fBcall_command()\fP instead
of \fBdjango\-admin\fP or \fBmanage.py\fP\&. For example, \fBdjango\-admin
createsuperuser \-\-no\-input\fP translates to \fBcall_command(\(aqcreatesuperuser\(aq,
interactive=False)\fP\&. To find what keyword argument name to use for
\fBcall_command()\fP, check the command\(aqs source code for the \fBdest\fP argument
passed to \fBparser.add_argument()\fP\&.
.sp
Command options which take multiple options are passed a list:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
management.call_command(\(aqdumpdata\(aq, exclude=[\(aqcontenttypes\(aq, \(aqauth\(aq])
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The return value of the \fBcall_command()\fP function is the same as the return
value of the \fBhandle()\fP method of the command.
.sp
\fBcall_command()\fP now returns the value received from the
\fBcommand.handle()\fP method. It now also accepts a command object as the
first argument.

.SH OUTPUT REDIRECTION
.sp
Note that you can redirect standard output and error streams as all commands
support the \fBstdout\fP and \fBstderr\fP options. For example, you could write:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
with open(\(aq/path/to/command_output\(aq) as f:
    management.call_command(\(aqdumpdata\(aq, stdout=f)
.ft P
.fi
