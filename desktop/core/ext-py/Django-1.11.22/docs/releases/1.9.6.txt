Django 1.9.6 release notes
==========================

*May 2, 2016*

Django 1.9.6 fixes several bugs in 1.9.5.

Bugfixes
========

* Added support for relative path redirects to the test client and to
  ``SimpleTestCase.assertRedirects()`` because Django 1.9 no longer converts
  redirects to absolute URIs (:ticket:`26428`).

* Fixed ``TimeField`` microseconds round-tripping on MySQL and SQLite
  (:ticket:`26498`).

* Prevented ``makemigrations`` from generating infinite migrations for a model
  field that references a ``functools.partial`` (:ticket:`26475`).

* Fixed a regression where ``SessionBase.pop()`` returned ``None`` rather than
  raising a ``KeyError`` for nonexistent values (:ticket:`26520`).

* Fixed a regression causing the cached template loader to crash when using
  template names starting with a dash (:ticket:`26536`).

* Restored conversion of an empty string to null when saving values of
  ``GenericIPAddressField`` on SQLite and MySQL (:ticket:`26557`).

* Fixed a ``makemessages`` regression where temporary ``.py`` extensions were
  leaked in source file paths (:ticket:`26341`).
