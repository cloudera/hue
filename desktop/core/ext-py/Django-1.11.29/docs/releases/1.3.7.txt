Django 1.3.7 release notes
==========================

*February 20, 2013*

Django 1.3.7 corrects a packaging problem with yesterday's :doc:`1.3.6 release
</releases/1.3.6>`.

The release contained stray ``.pyc`` files that caused "bad magic number"
errors when running with some versions of Python. This releases corrects this,
and also fixes a bad documentation link in the project template ``settings.py``
file generated by ``manage.py startproject``.
