Django 1.8.7 release notes
==========================

*November 24, 2015*

Django 1.8.7 fixes a security issue and several bugs in 1.8.6.

Additionally, Django's vendored version of six, :mod:`django.utils.six`, has
been upgraded to the latest release (1.10.0).

Fixed settings leak possibility in ``date`` template filter
===========================================================

If an application allows users to specify an unvalidated format for dates and
passes this format to the :tfilter:`date` filter, e.g.
``{{ last_updated|date:user_date_format }}``, then a malicious user could
obtain any secret in the application's settings by specifying a settings key
instead of a date format. e.g. ``"SECRET_KEY"`` instead of ``"j/m/Y"``.

To remedy this, the underlying function used by the ``date`` template filter,
``django.utils.formats.get_format()``, now only allows accessing the date/time
formatting settings.

========

* Fixed a crash of the debug view during the autumn DST change when

  ``allow_migrate()`` method to crash (:ticket:`25686`).

  in the ``migrations`` directory to fail (:ticket:`25618`).

  ``to_attr`` is set to a ``ManyToManyField`` (:ticket:`25693`).

  ``PositiveSmallIntegerField`` on MySQL resulting in values greater than
