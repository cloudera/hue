Django 1.11.27 release notes
============================

*December 18, 2019*

Django 1.11.27 fixes a security issue and a data loss bug in 1.11.26.

CVE-2019-19844: Potential account hijack via password reset form
================================================================

By submitting a suitably crafted email address making use of Unicode
characters, that compared equal to an existing user email when lower-cased for
comparison, an attacker could be sent a password reset token for the matched
account.

In order to avoid this vulnerability, password reset requests now compare the
submitted email using the stricter, recommended algorithm for case-insensitive
comparison of two identifiers from `Unicode Technical Report 36, section
2.11.2(B)(2)`__. Upon a match, the email containing the reset token will be
sent to the email address on record rather than the submitted address.

Bugfixes
========

* Fixed a data loss possibility in
  :class:`~django.contrib.postgres.forms.SplitArrayField`. When using with
  ``ArrayField(BooleanField())``, all values after the first ``True`` value
  were marked as checked instead of preserving passed values (:ticket:`31073`).
