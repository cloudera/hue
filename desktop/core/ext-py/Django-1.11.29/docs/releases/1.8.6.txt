Django 1.8.6 release notes
==========================

*November 4, 2015*

Django 1.8.6 adds official support for Python 3.5 and fixes several bugs in
1.8.5.

Bugfixes
========

* Fixed a regression causing ``ModelChoiceField`` to ignore
  ``prefetch_related()`` on its queryset (:ticket:`25496`).

* Allowed "mode=memory" in SQLite test database name if supported
  (:ticket:`12118`).

* Fixed system check crash on ``ForeignKey`` to abstract model
  (:ticket:`25503`).

* Fixed incorrect queries when you have multiple ``ManyToManyField``\s on
  different models that have the same field name, point to the same model, and
  have their reverse relations disabled (:ticket:`25545`).

* Allowed filtering over a ``RawSQL`` annotation (:ticket:`25506`).

* Made the ``Concat`` database function idempotent on SQLite (:ticket:`25517`).

* Avoided a confusing stack trace when starting :djadmin:`runserver` with an
  invalid :setting:`INSTALLED_APPS` setting (:ticket:`25510`). This regression
  appeared in 1.8.5 as a side effect of fixing :ticket:`24704`.

* Made deferred models use their proxied model's ``_meta.apps`` for caching
  and retrieval (:ticket:`25563`). This prevents any models generated in data
  migrations using ``QuerySet.defer()`` from leaking to test and application
  code.

* Fixed a typo in the name of the `strictly_above` PostGIS lookup
  (:ticket:`25592`).

* Fixed crash with ``contrib.postgres.forms.SplitArrayField`` and
  ``IntegerField`` on invalid value (:ticket:`25597`).

* Added a helpful error message when Django and South migrations exist in the
  same directory (:ticket:`25618`).

* Fixed a regression in ``URLValidator`` that allowed URLs with consecutive
  dots in the domain section (like ``http://example..com/``) to pass
  (:ticket:`25620`).

* Fixed a crash with ``GenericRelation`` and
  ``BaseModelAdmin.to_field_allowed`` (:ticket:`25622`).
