Installing Geospatial libraries
===============================

GeoDjango uses and/or provides interfaces for the following open source
geospatial libraries:

========================  ====================================  ================================  ===================================

Note that older or more recent versions of these libraries *may* also work
totally fine with GeoDjango. Your mileage may vary.

.. versionchanged:: 1.11

    In older versions, GDAL is required only for SQLite. Now it's required for
    all databases.

.. note::

    The GeoDjango interfaces to GEOS, GDAL, and GeoIP may be used
    independently of Django.  In other words, no database or settings file
    required -- just import them as normal from :mod:`django.contrib.gis`.

On Debian/Ubuntu, you are advised to install the following packages which will
install, directly or by dependency, the required geospatial libraries:

.. code-block:: console

    $ sudo apt-get install binutils libproj-dev gdal-bin

Optional packages to consider:

* ``libgeoip1``: for :doc:`GeoIP <../geoip2>` support
* ``python-gdal`` for GDAL's own Python bindings -- includes interfaces for raster manipulation

Please also consult platform-specific instructions if you are on :ref:`macos`
or :ref:`windows`.

.. _build_from_source:

Building from source
====================

When installing from source on UNIX and GNU/Linux systems, please follow
the installation instructions carefully, and install the libraries in the
given order.  If using MySQL or Oracle as the spatial database, only GEOS
is required.

.. note::

    On Linux platforms, it may be necessary to run the ``ldconfig`` command
    after installing each library. For example::

        $ sudo make install
        $ sudo ldconfig

.. note::

    macOS users must install `Xcode`_ in order to compile software from source.

.. _Xcode: https://developer.apple.com/xcode/

.. _geosbuild:

GEOS
----

GEOS is a C++ library for performing geometric operations, and is the default
internal geometry representation used by GeoDjango (it's behind the "lazy"
geometries).  Specifically, the C API library is called (e.g., ``libgeos_c.so``)
directly from Python using ctypes.

First, download GEOS 3.4.2 from the GEOS website and untar the source
archive::

    $ wget http://download.osgeo.org/geos/geos-3.4.2.tar.bz2
    $ tar xjf geos-3.4.2.tar.bz2

Next, change into the directory where GEOS was unpacked, run the configure
script, compile, and install::

    $ cd geos-3.4.2
    $ ./configure
    $ make
    $ sudo make install
    $ cd ..

Troubleshooting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Can't find GEOS library
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When GeoDjango can't find GEOS, this error is raised:

.. code-block:: text

    ImportError: Could not find the GEOS library (tried "geos_c"). Try setting GEOS_LIBRARY_PATH in your settings.

The most common solution is to properly configure your :ref:`libsettings` *or* set
:ref:`geoslibrarypath` in your settings.

If using a binary package of GEOS (e.g., on Ubuntu), you may need to :ref:`binutils`.

.. _geoslibrarypath:

``GEOS_LIBRARY_PATH``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If your GEOS library is in a non-standard location, or you don't want to
modify the system's library path then the :setting:`GEOS_LIBRARY_PATH`
setting may be added to your Django settings file with the full path to the
GEOS C library.  For example::

    GEOS_LIBRARY_PATH = '/home/bob/local/lib/libgeos_c.so'

.. note::

    The setting must be the *full* path to the **C** shared library; in
    other words you want to use ``libgeos_c.so``, not ``libgeos.so``.

See also :ref:`My logs are filled with GEOS-related errors <geos-exceptions-in-logfile>`.

.. _proj4:

PROJ.4
------

`PROJ.4`_ is a library for converting geospatial data to different coordinate
reference systems.

First, download the PROJ.4 source code and datum shifting files [#]_::

    $ wget http://download.osgeo.org/proj/proj-4.9.1.tar.gz
    $ wget http://download.osgeo.org/proj/proj-datumgrid-1.5.tar.gz

Next, untar the source code archive, and extract the datum shifting files in the
``nad`` subdirectory.  This must be done *prior* to configuration::

    $ tar xzf proj-4.9.1.tar.gz
    $ cd proj-4.9.1/nad
    $ tar xzf ../../proj-datumgrid-1.5.tar.gz
    $ cd ..

Finally, configure, make and install PROJ.4::

    $ ./configure
    $ make
    $ sudo make install
    $ cd ..

.. _gdalbuild:

GDAL
----

`GDAL`__ is an excellent open source geospatial library that has support for
reading most vector and raster spatial data formats.  Currently, GeoDjango only
supports :doc:`GDAL's vector data <../gdal>` capabilities [#]_.
:ref:`geosbuild` and :ref:`proj4` should be installed prior to building GDAL.

First download the latest GDAL release version and untar the archive::

    $ wget http://download.osgeo.org/gdal/1.11.2/gdal-1.11.2.tar.gz
    $ tar xzf gdal-1.11.2.tar.gz
    $ cd gdal-1.11.2

Configure, make and install::

    $ ./configure
    $ make # Go get some coffee, this takes a while.
    $ sudo make install
    $ cd ..

.. note::

    Because GeoDjango has its own Python interface, the preceding instructions
    do not build GDAL's own Python bindings. The bindings may be built by
    adding the ``--with-python`` flag when running ``configure``. See
    `GDAL/OGR In Python`__ for more information on GDAL's bindings.

If you have any problems, please see the troubleshooting section below for
suggestions and solutions.

Troubleshooting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Can't find GDAL library
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When GeoDjango can't find the GDAL library, configure your :ref:`libsettings`
*or* set :ref:`gdallibrarypath` in your settings.

.. _gdallibrarypath:

``GDAL_LIBRARY_PATH``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If your GDAL library is in a non-standard location, or you don't want to
modify the system's library path then the :setting:`GDAL_LIBRARY_PATH`
setting may be added to your Django settings file with the full path to
the GDAL library.  For example::

    GDAL_LIBRARY_PATH = '/home/sue/local/lib/libgdal.so'

.. rubric:: Footnotes
.. [#] The datum shifting files are needed for converting data to and from
       certain projections.
       For example, the PROJ.4 string for the `Google projection (900913 or 3857)
       <http://spatialreference.org/ref/sr-org/6864/prj/>`_ requires the
       ``null`` grid file only included in the extra datum shifting files.
       It is easier to install the shifting files now, then to have debug a
       problem caused by their absence later.
.. [#] Specifically, GeoDjango provides support for the `OGR
       <http://gdal.org/ogr_arch.html>`_ library, a component of GDAL.
