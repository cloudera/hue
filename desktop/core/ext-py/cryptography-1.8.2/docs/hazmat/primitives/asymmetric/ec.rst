.. hazmat::

Elliptic curve cryptography
===========================

.. module:: cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric.ec


.. function:: generate_private_key(curve, backend)

    .. versionadded:: 0.5

    Generate a new private key on ``curve`` for use with ``backend``.

    :param curve: An instance of :class:`EllipticCurve`.

    :param backend: An instance of
        :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.backends.interfaces.EllipticCurveBackend`.

    :returns: A new instance of :class:`EllipticCurvePrivateKey`.


.. function:: derive_private_key(private_value, curve, backend)

    .. versionadded:: 1.6

    Derive a private key from ``private_value`` on ``curve`` for use with
    ``backend``.

    :param int private_value: The secret scalar value.

    :param curve: An instance of :class:`EllipticCurve`.

    :param backend: An instance of
        :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.backends.interfaces.EllipticCurveBackend`.

    :returns: A new instance of :class:`EllipticCurvePrivateKey`.


Elliptic Curve Signature Algorithms
-----------------------------------

.. class:: ECDSA(algorithm)

    .. versionadded:: 0.5

    The ECDSA signature algorithm first standardized in NIST publication
    `FIPS 186-3`_, and later in `FIPS 186-4`_.

    :param algorithm: An instance of
        :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.hashes.HashAlgorithm`.

    .. doctest::

        >>> from cryptography.hazmat.backends import default_backend
        >>> from cryptography.hazmat.primitives import hashes
        >>> from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric import ec
        >>> private_key = ec.generate_private_key(
        ...     ec.SECP384R1(), default_backend()
        ... )
        >>> signer = private_key.signer(ec.ECDSA(hashes.SHA256()))
        >>> signer.update(b"this is some data I'd like")
        >>> signer.update(b" to sign")
        >>> signature = signer.finalize()

    There is a shortcut to sign sufficiently short messages directly:

    .. doctest::

        >>> data = b"this is some data I'd like to sign"
        >>> signature = private_key.sign(
        ...     data,
        ...     ec.ECDSA(hashes.SHA256())
        ... )

    The ``signature`` is a ``bytes`` object, whose contents is DER encoded as
    described in :rfc:`3279`. This can be decoded using
    :func:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric.utils.decode_dss_signature`.


    Verification requires the public key, the signature itself, the signed data, and knowledge of the hashing algorithm that was used when producing the signature:

    >>> public_key = private_key.public_key()
    >>> verifier = public_key.verifier(signature, ec.ECDSA(hashes.SHA256()))
    >>> verifier.update(b"this is some data I'd like")
    >>> verifier.update(b" to sign")
    >>> verifier.verify()
    True

    The last call will either return ``True`` or raise an :class:`~cryptography.exceptions.InvalidSignature` exception.

    .. note::
        Although in this case the public key was derived from the private one, in a typical setting you will not possess the private key. The `Key loading`_ section explains how to load the public key from other sources.

        :returns: A new instance of :class:`EllipticCurvePublicKey`.

    .. method:: encode_point()

        .. versionadded:: 1.1

        Encodes an elliptic curve point to a byte string as described in
        `SEC 1 v2.0`_ section 2.3.3. This method only supports uncompressed
        points.

        :return bytes: The encoded point.

    .. classmethod:: from_encoded_point(curve, data)

        .. versionadded:: 1.1

        Decodes a byte string as described in `SEC 1 v2.0`_ section 2.3.3 and

        :param curve: An
            :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric.ec.EllipticCurve`
            instance.

        :param bytes data: The serialized point byte string.

        :returns: An :class:`EllipticCurvePublicNumbers` instance.

        :raises TypeError: Raised when curve is not an

Elliptic Curve Key Exchange algorithm
-------------------------------------

.. class:: ECDH()

    .. versionadded:: 1.1

    The Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange algorithm first standardized
    in NIST publication `800-56A`_, and later in `800-56Ar2`_.

    For most applications the ``shared_key`` should be passed to a key
    derivation function.

    .. doctest::

        >>> from cryptography.hazmat.backends import default_backend
        >>> from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric import ec
        >>> private_key = ec.generate_private_key(
        ...     ec.SECP384R1(), default_backend()
        ... )
        >>> peer_public_key = ec.generate_private_key(
        ...     ec.SECP384R1(), default_backend()
        ... ).public_key()
        >>> shared_key = private_key.exchange(ec.ECDH(), peer_public_key)

    ECDHE (or EECDH), the ephemeral form of this exchange, is **strongly
    preferred** over simple ECDH and provides `forward secrecy`_ when used.
    You must generate a new private key using :func:`generate_private_key` for
    each :meth:`~EllipticCurvePrivateKey.exchange` when performing an ECDHE key
    exchange.

Elliptic Curves
---------------

Elliptic curves provide equivalent security at much smaller key sizes than
other asymmetric cryptography systems such as RSA or DSA. For many operations
elliptic curves are also significantly faster; `elliptic curve diffie-hellman
is faster than diffie-hellman`_.

.. note::
    Curves with a size of `less than 224 bits`_ should not be used. You should
    strongly consider using curves of at least 224 bits.

Generally the NIST prime field ("P") curves are significantly faster than the
other types suggested by NIST at both signing and verifying with ECDSA.

Prime fields also `minimize the number of security concerns for elliptic-curve
cryptography`_. However, there is `some concern`_ that both the prime field and
binary field ("B") NIST curves may have been weakened during their generation.

Currently `cryptography` only supports NIST curves, none of which are
considered "safe" by the `SafeCurves`_ project run by Daniel J. Bernstein and
Tanja Lange.

All named curves are instances of :class:`EllipticCurve`.

    .. versionadded:: 0.6

Serialization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This sample demonstrates how to generate a private key and serialize it.


.. doctest::

    >>> from cryptography.hazmat.backends import default_backend
    >>> from cryptography.hazmat.primitives import hashes
    >>> from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric import ec
    >>> from cryptography.hazmat.primitives import serialization

    >>> private_key = ec.generate_private_key(ec.SECP384R1(), default_backend())

    >>> serialized_private = private_key.private_bytes(
    ...     encoding=serialization.Encoding.PEM,
    ...     format=serialization.PrivateFormat.PKCS8,
    ...     encryption_algorithm=serialization.BestAvailableEncryption(b'testpassword')
    ...     )
    >>> serialized_private.splitlines()[0]
    '-----BEGIN ENCRYPTED PRIVATE KEY-----'

You can also serialize the key without a password, by relying on
:class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.serialization.NoEncryption`.

The public key is serialized as follows:


.. doctest::

    >>> public_key = private_key.public_key()
    >>> serialized_public = public_key.public_bytes(
    ...     encoding=serialization.Encoding.PEM,
    ...     format=serialization.PublicFormat.SubjectPublicKeyInfo
    ...     )
    >>> serialized_public.splitlines()[0]
    '-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----'

This is the part that you would normally share with the rest of the world.


Key loading
~~~~~~~~~~~

This extends the sample in the previous section, assuming that the variables
``serialized_private`` and ``serialized_public`` contain the respective keys
in PEM format.

.. doctest::

    >>> loaded_public_key = serialization.load_pem_public_key(
    ...    serialized_public,
    ...    backend=default_backend()
    ...    )

    >>> loaded_private_key = serialization.load_pem_private_key(
    ...    serialized_private,
    ...    password=b'testpassword',  # or password=None, if in plain text
    ...    backend=default_backend()
    ...    )
