-----------

Version 0.9.2
-------------

(released on February 4th 2008)

- Fixed catalogs' charset values not being recognized (:trac:`66`).
- Numerous improvements to the default plural forms.
- Fixed fuzzy matching when updating message catalogs (:trac:`82`).
- Fixed bug in catalog updating, that in some cases pulled in translations
  from different catalogs based on the same template.
- Location lines in PO files do no longer get wrapped at hyphens in file
  names (:trac:`79`).
- Fixed division by zero error in catalog compilation on empty catalogs
  (:trac:`60`).


Version 0.9.1
-------------

(released on September 7th 2007)

- Fixed catalog updating when a message is merged that was previously simple
  but now has a plural form, for example by moving from `gettext` to
  `ngettext`, or vice versa.
- Fixed time formatting for 12 am and 12 pm.
- Fixed output encoding of the `pybabel --list-locales` command.
- MO files are now written in binary mode on windows (:trac:`61`).


Version 0.9
-----------

(released on August 20th 2007)

- The `new_catalog` distutils command has been renamed to `init_catalog` for
  consistency with the command-line frontend.
- Added compilation of message catalogs to MO files (:trac:`21`).
- Added updating of message catalogs from POT files (:trac:`22`).
- Support for significant digits in number formatting.
- Apply proper "banker's rounding" in number formatting in a cross-platform
  manner.
- The number formatting functions now also work with numbers represented by
  Python `Decimal` objects (:trac:`53`).
- Added extensible infrastructure for validating translation catalogs.
- Fixed the extractor not filtering out messages that didn't validate against
  the keyword's specification (:trac:`39`).
- Fixed the extractor raising an exception when encountering an empty string
  msgid. It now emits a warning to stderr.
- Numerous Python message extractor fixes: it now handles nested function
  calls within a gettext function call correctly, uses the correct line number
  for multi-line function calls, and other small fixes (tickets :trac:`38` and
  :trac:`39`).
- Improved support for detecting Python string formatting fields in message
  strings (:trac:`57`).
- CLDR upgraded to the 1.5 release.
- Improved timezone formatting.
- Implemented scientific number formatting.
- Added mechanism to lookup locales by alias, for cases where browsers insist
  on including only the language code in the `Accept-Language` header, and
  sometimes even the incorrect language code.


Version 0.8.1
-------------

(released on July 2nd 2007)

- `default_locale()` would fail when the value of the `LANGUAGE` environment
  variable contained multiple language codes separated by colon, as is
  explicitly allowed by the GNU gettext tools. As the `default_locale()`
  function is called at the module level in some modules, this bug would
  completely break importing these modules on systems where `LANGUAGE` is set
  that way.
- The character set specified in PO template files is now respected when
  creating new catalog files based on that template. This allows the use of
  characters outside the ASCII range in POT files (:trac:`17`).
- The default ordering of messages in generated POT files, which is based on
  the order those messages are found when walking the source tree, is no
  longer subject to differences between platforms; directory and file names
  are now always sorted alphabetically.
- The Python message extractor now respects the special encoding comment to be
  able to handle files containing non-ASCII characters (:trac:`23`).
- Added ``N_`` (gettext noop) to the extractor's default keywords.
- Made locale string parsing more robust, and also take the script part into
  account (:trac:`27`).
- Added a function to list all locales for which locale data is available.
- Added a command-line option to the `pybabel` command which prints out all
  available locales (:trac:`24`).
- The name of the command-line script has been changed from just `babel` to
  `pybabel` to avoid a conflict with the OpenBabel project (:trac:`34`).
