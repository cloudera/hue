Hi Andrew,

People often ask me what license PyCrypto is covered by, if it's=20
GPL-compatible, etc.  Right now, I'm not really sure what to tell them. =20
The text in the current LICENSE file (quoted below) is not entirely clear=
=20
on the point of whether distributing modified versions is allowed.  (It=20
says "distribute and use", but not "modify".)

     =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=

     Distribute and use freely; there are no restrictions on further
     dissemination and usage except those imposed by the laws of your
     country of residence.  This software is provided "as is" without
     warranty of fitness for use or suitability for any purpose, express

     Incorporating the code into commercial products is permitted; you do
     not have to make source available or contribute your changes back
     (though that would be nice).

For the next PyCrypto release, I'd like to take steps to move toward a=20
clearer licensing regime.  I'm asking as many copyright holders as I can=20
find, starting with you, if I can release PyCrypto under something clearer=
=20
and more standard.  Below, I have quoted a public domain dedication that=20
was recommended in _Intellectual Property and Open Source: A Practical=20
Guide to Protecting Code_, by Van Lindberg.

May I, on your behalf, dedicate to the public domain your considerable=20
contributions to PyCrypto, with the following notice?

The intention is that it be public domain.
