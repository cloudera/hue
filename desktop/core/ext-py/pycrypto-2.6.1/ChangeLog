2.6.1
=====
	* [CVE-2013-1445] Fix PRNG not correctly reseeded in some situations.

	  In previous versions of PyCrypto, the Crypto.Random PRNG exhibits a
	  race condition that may cause forked processes to generate identical
	  sequences of 'random' numbers.

	  This is a fairly obscure bug that will (hopefully) not affect many
	  applications, but the failure scenario is pretty bad.  Here is some
	  sample code that illustrates the problem:

	      from binascii import hexlify
	      import multiprocessing, pprint, time
	      import Crypto.Random

	      def task_main(arg):
	          a = Crypto.Random.get_random_bytes(8)
	          time.sleep(0.1)
	          b = Crypto.Random.get_random_bytes(8)
	          rdy, ack = arg
	          rdy.set()
	          ack.wait()
	          return "%s,%s" % (hexlify(a).decode(),
	                            hexlify(b).decode())

	      n_procs = 4
	      manager = multiprocessing.Manager()
	      rdys = [manager.Event() for i in range(n_procs)]
	      acks = [manager.Event() for i in range(n_procs)]
	      Crypto.Random.get_random_bytes(1)
	      pool = multiprocessing.Pool(processes=n_procs,
	                                  initializer=Crypto.Random.atfork)
	      res_async = pool.map_async(task_main, zip(rdys, acks))
	      pool.close()
	      [rdy.wait() for rdy in rdys]
	      [ack.set() for ack in acks]
	      res = res_async.get()
	      pprint.pprint(sorted(res))
	      pool.join()

	  The output should be random, but it looked like this:

	      ['c607803ae01aa8c0,2e4de6457a304b34',
	       'c607803ae01aa8c0,af80d08942b4c987',
	       'c607803ae01aa8c0,b0e4c0853de927c4',
	       'c607803ae01aa8c0,f0362585b3fceba4']

	  This release fixes the problem by resetting the rate-limiter when
	  Crypto.Random.atfork() is invoked.  It also adds some tests and a
	  few related comments.

2.6
===
	* [CVE-2012-2417] Fix LP#985164: insecure ElGamal key generation.
	  (thanks: Legrandin)

	  In the ElGamal schemes (for both encryption and signatures), g is
	  supposed to be the generator of the entire Z^*_p group.  However, in
	  PyCrypto 2.5 and earlier, g is more simply the generator of a random
	  sub-group of Z^*_p.

	  The result is that the signature space (when the key is used for
	  signing) or the public key space (when the key is used for encryption)
	  may be greatly reduced from its expected size of log(p) bits, possibly
	  down to 1 bit (the worst case if the order of g is 2).

	  While it has not been confirmed, it has also been suggested that an
	  attacker might be able to use this fact to determine the private key.

	  Anyone using ElGamal keys should generate new keys as soon as practical.

	  Any additional information about this bug will be tracked at
	  https://bugs.launchpad.net/pycrypto/+bug/985164

	* Huge documentation cleanup (thanks: Legrandin).

	* Added more tests, including test vectors from NIST 800-38A
	  (thanks: Legrandin)

	* Remove broken MODE_PGP, which never actually worked properly.
	  A new mode, MODE_OPENPGP, has been added for people wishing to write
	  OpenPGP implementations.  Note that this does not implement the full
	  OpenPGP specification, only the "OpenPGP CFB mode" part of that
	  specification.
	  https://bugs.launchpad.net/pycrypto/+bug/996814

	* Fix: getPrime with invalid input causes Python to abort with fatal error
	  https://bugs.launchpad.net/pycrypto/+bug/988431

	* Fix: Segfaults within error-handling paths
	  (thanks: Paul Howarth & Dave Malcolm)
	  https://bugs.launchpad.net/pycrypto/+bug/934294

	* Fix: Block ciphers allow empty string as IV
	  https://bugs.launchpad.net/pycrypto/+bug/997464

	* Fix DevURandomRNG to work with Python3's new I/O stack.
	  (thanks: Sebastian Ramacher)

	* Remove automagic dependencies on libgmp and libmpir, let the caller
	  disable them using args.

	* Many other minor bug fixes and improvements (mostly thanks to Legrandin)

2.5
===
	* Added PKCS#1 encryption schemes (v1.5 and OAEP).  We now have
	  a decent, easy-to-use non-textbook RSA implementation.  Yay!

	* Added PKCS#1 signature schemes (v1.5 and PSS). v1.5 required some
	  extensive changes to Hash modules to contain the algorithm specific
	  ASN.1 OID. To that end, we now always have a (thin) Python module to
	  hide the one in pure C.

	* Added 2 standard Key Derivation Functions (PBKDF1 and PBKDF2).

	* Added export/import of RSA keys in OpenSSH and PKCS#8 formats.

	* Added password-protected export/import of RSA keys (one old method
	  for PKCS#8 PEM only).

	* Added ability to generate RSA key pairs with configurable public
	  exponent e.

	* Added ability to construct an RSA key pair even if only the private
	  exponent d is known, and not p and q.

	* Added SHA-2 C source code (fully from Lorenz Quack).

	* Unit tests for all the above.

	* Updates to documentation (both inline and in Doc/pycrypt.rst)

	* All of the above changes were put together by Legrandin (Thanks!)

	* Minor bug fixes (setup.py and tests).

2.4.1
=====
	* Fix "error: Setup script exited with error: src/config.h: No such file or
	  directory" when installing via easy_install.  (Sebastian Ramacher)

2.4
===
	* Python 3 support!  (Thorsten E. Behrens, Anders Sundman)
	  PyCrypto now supports every version of Python from 2.1 through 3.2.

	* Timing-attack countermeasures in _fastmath: When built against
	  libgmp version 5 or later, we use mpz_powm_sec instead of mpz_powm.
	  This should prevent the timing attack described by Geremy Condra at
	  PyCon 2011:
	  http://blip.tv/pycon-us-videos-2009-2010-2011/pycon-2011-through-the-side-channel-timing-and-implementation-attacks-in-python-4897955

	* New hash modules (for Python >= 2.5 only): SHA224, SHA384, and
	  SHA512 (Frédéric Bertolus)

	* Configuration using GNU autoconf.  This should help fix a bunch of
	  build issues.

	* Support using MPIR as an alternative to GMP.

	* Improve the test command in setup.py, by allowing tests to be
	  performed on a single sub-package or module only. (Legrandin)

	  You can now do something like this:

	    python setup.py test -m Hash.SHA256 --skip-slow-tests

	* Fix double-decref of "counter" when Cipher object initialisation
	  fails (Ryan Kelly)

	* Apply patches from Debian's python-crypto 2.3-3 package (Jan
	  Dittberner, Sebastian Ramacher):
	 - fix-RSA-generate-exception.patch
	 - epydoc-exclude-introspect.patch
	 - no-usr-local.patch

	* Fix launchpad bug #702835: "Import key code is not compatible with
	  GMP library" (Legrandin)

	* More tests, better documentation, various bugfixes.

2.3
===
	* Fix NameError when attempting to use deprecated getRandomNumber()
	  function.

	* _slowmath: Compute RSA u parameter when it's not given to
	  RSA.construct. This makes _slowmath behave the same as _fastmath in
	  this regard.

	* Make RSA.generate raise a more user-friendly exception message when
	  the user tries to generate a bogus-length key.


2.2
===

	* Deprecated Crypto.Util.number.getRandomNumber(), which had confusing
	  semantics.  It's been replaced by getRandomNBitInteger and
	  getRandomInteger.  (Thanks: Lorenz Quack)

	* Better isPrime() and getPrime() implementations that do a real
	  Rabin-Miller probabilistic primality test (not the phony test we did
	  before with fixed bases).  (Thanks: Lorenz Quack)

	* getStrongPrime() implementation for generating RSA primes.
	  (Thanks: Lorenz Quack)

	* Support for importing and exporting RSA keys in DER and PEM format.
	  (Thanks: Legrandin)

	* Fix PyCrypto when floor division (python -Qnew) is enabled.

	* When building using gcc, use -std=c99 for compilation.  This should
	  fix building on FreeBSD and NetBSD.


2.1.0
=====

	* Fix building PyCrypto on Win64 using MS Visual Studio 9.
	  (Thanks: Nevins Bartolomeo.)


2.1.0beta1
==========

	* Modified RSA.generate() to ensure that e is coprime to p-1 and q-1.
	  Apparently, RSA.generate was capable of generating unusable keys.


2.1.0alpha2
===========

	* Modified isPrime() to release the global interpreter lock while
	  performing computations. (patch from Lorenz Quack)

	* Release the GIL while encrypting, decrypting, and hashing (but not
	  during initialization or finalization).

	* API changes:

	  - Removed RandomPoolCompat and made Crypto.Util.randpool.RandomPool
	    a wrapper around Crypto.Random that emits a DeprecationWarning.
	    This is to discourage developers from attempting to provide
	    backwards compatibility for systems where there are NO strong
	    entropy sources available.

	  - Added Crypto.Random.get_random_bytes().  This should allow people
	    to use something like this if they want backwards-compatibility:

	        try:
	             from Crypto.Random import get_random_bytes
	        except ImportError:
	             try:
	                 from os import urandom as get_random_bytes
	             except ImportError:
	                 get_random_bytes = open("/dev/urandom", "rb").read

	  - Implemented __ne__() on pubkey, which fixes the following broken
	    behaviour:
	        >>> pk.publickey() == pk.publickey()
	        True
	        >>> pk.publickey() != pk.publickey()
	        True
	    (patch from Lorenz Quack)

	  - Block ciphers created with MODE_CTR can now operate on strings of
	    any size, rather than just multiples of the underlying cipher's
	    block size.

	  - Crypto.Util.Counter objects now raise OverflowError when they wrap
	    around to zero.  You can override this new behaviour by passing
	    allow_wraparound=True to Counter.new()


2.1.0alpha1
===========

	* This version supports Python versions 2.1 through 2.6.

	* Clarified copyright status of much of the existing code by tracking
	  down Andrew M. Kuchling, Barry A. Warsaw, Jeethu Rao, Joris Bontje,
	  Mark Moraes, Paul Swartz, Robey Pointer, and Wim Lewis and getting
	  their permission to clarify the license/public-domain status of their
	  contributions.  Many thanks to all involved!

	* Replaced the test suite with a new, comprehensive package
	  (Crypto.SelfTest) that includes documentation about where its test
	  vectors came from, or how they were derived.

	  Use "python setup.py test" to run the tests after building.

	* API changes:

	  - Added Crypto.version_info, which from now on will contain version
	    information in a format similar to Python's sys.version_info.

	  - Added a new random numbers API (Crypto.Random), and deprecated the
	    old one (Crypto.Util.randpool.RandomPool), which was misused more
	    often than not.

	    The new API is used by invoking Crypto.Random.new() and then just
	    reading from the file-like object that is returned.

	    CAVEAT: To maintain the security of the PRNG, you must call
	    Crypto.Random.atfork() in both the parent and the child processes
	    whenever you use os.fork().  Otherwise, the parent and child will
	    share copies of the same entropy pool, causing them to return the
	    same results!  This is a limitation of Python, which does not
	    provide readily-accessible hooks to os.fork().  It's also a
	    limitation caused by the failure of operating systems to provide
	    sufficiently fast, trustworthy sources of cryptographically-strong
	    random numbers.

	  - Crypto.PublicKey now raises ValueError/TypeError/RuntimeError
	    instead of the various custom "error" exceptions

	  - Removed the IDEA and RC5 modules due to software patents.  Debian
	    has been doing this for a while

	  - Added Crypto.Random.random, a strong version of the standard Python
	   'random' module.

	  - Added Crypto.Util.Counter, providing fast counter implementations
	    for use with CTR-mode ciphers.

	* Bug fixes:

	  - Fixed padding bug in SHA256; this resulted in bad digests whenever
	    (the number of bytes hashed) mod 64 == 55.

	  - Fixed a 32-bit limitation on the length of messages the SHA256 module
	    could hash.

	  - AllOrNothing: Fixed padding bug in digest()

	  - Fixed a bad behaviour of the XOR cipher module: It would silently
	    truncate all keys to 32 bytes.  Now it raises ValueError when the
	    key is too long.

	  - DSA: Added code to enforce FIPS 186-2 requirements on the size of
	    the prime p

	  - Fixed the winrandom module, which had been omitted from the build
	    process, causing security problems for programs that misuse RandomPool.

	  - Fixed infinite loop when attempting to generate RSA keys with an
	    odd number of bits in the modulus.  (Not that you should do that.)

	* Clarified the documentation for Crypto.Util.number.getRandomNumber.

	  Confusingly, this function does NOT return N random bits; It returns
	  a random N-bit number, i.e. a random number between 2**(N-1) and (2**N)-1.

	  Note that getRandomNumber is for internal use only and may be
	  renamed or removed in future releases.

	* Replaced RIPEMD.c with a new implementation (RIPEMD160.c) to
	  alleviate copyright concerns.

	* Replaced the DES/DES3 modules with ones based on libtomcrypt-1.16 to
	  alleviate copyright concerns.

	* Replaced Blowfish.c with a new implementation to alleviate copyright
	  concerns.

	* Added a string-XOR implementation written in C (Crypto.Util.strxor)
	  and used it to speed up Crypto.Hash.HMAC

	* Converted documentation to reStructured Text.

	* Added epydoc configuration Doc/epydoc-config

	* setup.py now emits a warning when building without GMP.

	* Added pct-speedtest.py to the source tree for doing performance
	  testing on the new code.

	* Cleaned up the code in several places.


2.0.1
=====

	* Fix SHA256 and RIPEMD on AMD64 platform.
        * Deleted Demo/ directory.
	* Add PublicKey to Crypto.__all__


2.0
===

	* Added SHA256 module contributed by Jeethu Rao, with test data
	  from Taylor Boon.

	* Fixed AES.c compilation problems with Borland C.  
	  (Contributed by Jeethu Rao.)

	* Fix ZeroDivisionErrors on Windows, caused by the system clock
	  not having enough resolution.
	
        * Fix 2.1/2.2-incompatible use of (key not in dict),
	  pointed out by Ian Bicking.

	* Fix FutureWarning in Crypto.Util.randpool, noted by James P Rutledge.

	
1.9alpha6
=========

	* Util.number.getPrime() would inadvertently round off the bit
	  size; if you asked for a 129-bit prime or 135-bit prime, you
	  got a 128-bit prime.

	* Added Util/test/prime_speed.py to measure the speed of prime
 	  generation, and PublicKey/test/rsa_speed.py to measure
	  the speed of RSA operations.

	* Merged the _rsa.c and _dsa.c files into a single accelerator
	  module, _fastmath.c.  

	* Speed improvements: Added fast isPrime() function to _fastmath,
	  cutting the time to generate a 1024-bit prime by a factor of 10.
	  Optimized the C version of RSA decryption to use a longer series
	  of operations that's roughly 3x faster than a single
	  exponentiation.  (Contributed by Joris Bontje.)

	* Added support to RSA key objects for blinding and unblinding 
	  data. (Contributed by Joris Bontje.)

	* Simplified RSA key generation: hard-wired the encryption
	  exponent to 65537 instead of generating a random prime;
	  generate prime factors in a loop until the product 
	  is large enough.
	
	* Renamed cansign(), canencrypt(), hasprivate(), to 
	  can_sign, can_encrypt, has_private.  If people shriek about
	  this change very loudly, I'll add aliases for the old method
	  names that log a warning and call the new method.
	

1.9alpha5
=========

        * Many randpool changes.  RandomPool now has a
          randomize(N:int) method that can be called to get N
          bytes of entropy for the pool (N defaults to 0,
          which 'fills up' the pool's entropy) KeyboardRandom
          overloads this method.

        * Added src/winrand.c for Crypto.Util.winrandom and
          now use winrandom for _randomize if possible.
          (Calls Windows CryptoAPI CryptGenRandom)

        * Several additional places for stirring the pool,
          capturing inter-event entropy when reading/writing,
          stirring before and after saves.

        * RandomPool.add_event now returns the number of
          estimated bits of added entropy, rather than the
          pool entropy itself (since the pool entropy is
          capped at the number of bits in the pool)

        * Moved termios code from KeyboardRandomPool into a
          KeyboardEntry class, provided a version for Windows
          using msvcrt.

        * Fix randpool.py crash on machines with poor timer resolution.
          (Reported by Mark Moraes and others.)

        * If the GNU GMP library is available, two C extensions will be 
          compiled to speed up RSA and DSA operations.  (Contributed by 
          Paul Swartz.)

        * DES3 with a 24-byte key was broken; now fixed.  
	  (Patch by Philippe Frycia.)


1.9alpha4
=========

        * Fix compilation problem on Windows.

        * HMAC.py fixed to work with pre-2.2 Pythons
        
        * setup.py now dies if built with Python 1.x
        

1.9alpha3
=========

        * Fix a ref-counting bug that caused core dumps.  
          (Reported by Piers Lauder and an anonymous SF poster.)
        

1.9alpha2
=========

        * (Backwards incompatible) The old Crypto.Hash.HMAC module is
          gone, replaced by a copy of hmac.py from Python 2.2's standard
          library.  It will display a warning on interpreter versions
          older than 2.2.
        
        * (Backwards incompatible) Restored the Crypto.Protocol package,
          and modernized and tidied up the two modules in it,
          AllOrNothing.py and Chaffing.py, renaming various methods
          and changing the interface.
          
        * (Backwards incompatible) Changed the function names in
          Crypto.Util.RFC1751.
        
        * Restored the Crypto.PublicKey package at user request.  I
          think I'll leave it in the package and warn about it in the
          documentation.  I hope that eventually I can point to
          someone else's better public-key code, and at that point I
          may insert warnings and begin the process of deprecating
          this code.

        * Fix use of a Python 2.2 C function, replacing it with a 
          2.1-compatible equivalent.  (Bug report and patch by Andrew
          Eland.)  

        * Fix endianness bugs that caused test case failures on Sparc,
          PPC, and doubtless other platforms.

        * Fixed compilation problem on FreeBSD and MacOS X.
        
        * Expanded the test suite (requires Sancho, from 
          http://www.mems-exchange.org/software/sancho/)

        * Added lots of docstrings, so 'pydoc Crypto' now produces 
          helpful output.  (Open question: maybe *all* of the documentation
          should be moved into docstrings?)
          
        * Make test.py automatically add the build/* directory to sys.path.

        * Removed 'inline' declaration from C functions.  Some compilers
          don't support it, and Python's pyconfig.h no longer tells you whether
          it's supported or not.  After this change, some ciphers got slower,
          but others got faster.
          
        * The C-level API has been changed to reduce the amount of
          memory-to-memory copying.   This makes the code neater, but 
          had ambiguous performance effects; again, some ciphers got slower
          and others became faster.  Probably this is due to my compiler
          optimizing slightly worse or better as a result.

        * Moved C source implementations into src/ from block/, hash/, 
          and stream/.  Having Hash/ and hash/ directories causes problems
          on case-insensitive filesystems such as Mac OS.

        * Cleaned up the C code for the extensions.
                
        
1.9alpha1
=========

        * Added Crypto.Cipher.AES.

        * Added the CTR mode and the variable-sized CFB mode from the
          NIST standard on feedback modes. 
        
        * Removed Diamond, HAVAL, MD5, Sapphire, SHA, and Skipjack.  MD5
          and SHA are included with Python; the others are all of marginal
          usefulness in the real world.

        * Renamed the module-level constants ECB, CFB, &c., to MODE_ECB,
          MODE_CFB, as part of making the block encryption modules 
          compliant with PEP 272.  (I'm not sure about this change;
          if enough users complain about it, I might back it out.)
        
        * Made the hashing modules compliant with PEP 247 (not backward
          compatible -- the major changes are that the constructor is now 
          MD2.new and not MD2.MD2, and the size of the digest is now 
          given as 'digest_size', not 'digestsize'.

        * The Crypto.PublicKey package is no longer installed; the
          interfaces are all wrong, and I have no idea what the right
          interfaces should be.  


1.1alpha2
=========
        * Most importantly, the distribution has been broken into two
parts: exportable, and export-controlled.  The exportable part
contains all the hashing algorithms, signature-only public key
algorithms, chaffing & winnowing, random number generation, various
utility modules, and the documentation.

        The export-controlled part contains public-key encryption
algorithms such as RSA and ElGamal, and bulk encryption algorithms
like DES, IDEA, or Skipjack.  Getting this code still requires that
you go through an access control CGI script, and denies you access if
you're outside the US or Canada.

        * Added the RIPEMD hashing algorithm.  (Contributed by
Hirendra Hindocha.)

        * Implemented the recently declassified Skipjack block
encryption algorithm.  My implementation runs at 864 K/sec on a
PII/266, which isn't particularly fast, but you're probably better off
using another algorithm anyway.  :)

        * A simple XOR cipher has been added, mostly for use by the
chaffing/winnowing code.  (Contributed by Barry Warsaw.)

        * Added Protocol.Chaffing and Hash.HMAC.py.  (Contributed by
Barry Warsaw.)  

        Protocol.Chaffing implements chaffing and winnowing, recently
proposed by R. Rivest, which hides a message (the wheat) by adding
many noise messages to it (the chaff).  The chaff can be discarded by
the receiver through a message authentication code.  The neat thing
about this is that it allows secret communication without actually
having an encryption algorithm, and therefore this falls within the
exportable subset.  

        * Tidied up randpool.py, and removed its use of a block
cipher; this makes it work with only the export-controlled subset
available.

        * Various renamings and reorganizations, mostly internal.

        
1.0.2
=====

        * Changed files to work with Python 1.5; everything has been
re-arranged into a hierarchical package.  (Not backward compatible.)
The package organization is:
Crypto.
        Hash.
                MD2, MD4, MD5, SHA, HAVAL
        Cipher.
                ARC2, ARC4, Blowfish, CAST, DES, DES3, Diamond, 
                IDEA, RC5, Sapphire
        PublicKey.
                DSA, ElGamal, qNEW, RSA
        Util.
                number, randpool, RFC1751

        Since this is backward-incompatible anyway, I also changed
module names from all lower-case to mixed-case: diamond -> Diamond,
rc5 -> RC5, etc.  That had been an annoying inconsistency for a while.
        
        * Added CAST5 module contributed by <wiml@hhhh.org>.

        * Added qNEW digital signature algorithm (from the digisign.py
I advertised a while back).  (If anyone would like to suggest new
algorithms that should be implemented, please do; I think I've got
everything that's really useful at the moment, but...)

        * Support for keyword arguments has been added.  This allowed
removing the obnoxious key handling for Diamond and RC5, where the
first few bytes of the key indicated the number of rounds to use, and
various other parameters.  Now you need only do something like:

from Crypto.Cipher import RC5
obj = RC5.new(key, RC5.ECB, rounds=8)

(Not backward compatible.) 

        * Various function names have been changed, and parameter
names altered.  None of these were part of the public interface, so it
shouldn't really matter much.

        * Various bugs fixed, the test suite has been expanded, and
the build process simplified.

        * Updated the documentation accordingly.

        
1.0.1
=====
        
        * Changed files to work with Python 1.4 .

        * The DES and DES3 modules now automatically correct the
parity of their keys.
        
        * Added R. Rivest's DES test (see http://theory.lcs.mit.edu/~rivest/destest.txt)


1.0.0
=====

        * REDOC III succumbed to differential cryptanalysis, and has
been removed. 

        * The crypt and rotor modules have been dropped; they're still
available in the standard Python distribution. 

        * The Ultra-Fast crypt() module has been placed in a separate
distribution.

        * Various bugs fixed.
