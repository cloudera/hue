Extensions
----------

Extend the reStructuredText syntax or the features of Docutils.
More extensions are in the `Docutils Sandbox`_.

* Beni Cherniavsky has written a generic `preprocessing module`_ for
  roles and/or directives and built preprocessors for TeX math for
  both LaTeX and HTML output on top of it.

* Beni Cherniavsky maintains a Makefile_ for driving Docutils, hoping
  to handle everything one might do with Docutils.

* The `ASCII art to SVG converter`_ (aafigure) developed by
  Chris Liechti can parse ASCII art images, embedded in reST documents and
  output an image. This would mean that simple illustrations could be
  embedded as ASCII art in the reST source and still look nice when
  converted to e.g. HTML

* zot4rst_ by Erik Hetzner is an extension that allows users to write reST
  documents using citations from a Zotero_ library.

* Quick and easy publishing reStructuredText source files as blog posts
  on blogger.com is possible with `rst2blogger`_ .

--------------------

Applications using docutils/reStructuredText and helper applications.

* For Wikis, please see the `FAQ entry about Wikis`_.

* For Blogs (Weblogs), please see the `FAQ entry about Blogs`_.

* `Project Gutenberg`_ uses a customized version of Docutils with it's own
  xetex- and nroff-writer and epub generator.

Tools
`````

* rstcheck_ Checks syntax of reStructuredText and code blocks nested within
  it. (Using the Sphinx syntax "code-block" for the "code" directive.)

  .. _rstcheck: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/rstcheck

* restview_ is a viewer for ReStructuredText documents.

  Pass the name of a ReStructuredText document to restview, and it will
  launch a web server on localhost:random-port and open a web browser. It
  will also watch for changes in that file and automatically reload and
  rerender it. This is very convenient for previewing a document while
  you're editing it.

  .. _restview: http://mg.pov.lt/restview/


Development
```````````

* Sphinx_ extends the ReStructuredText syntax to better support the
  documentation of Software (and other) *projects* (but other documents
  can be written with it too).

  Since version 2.6, the `Python documentation`_ is based on
  reStructuredText and Sphinx.

* Trac_, a project management and bug/issue tracking system, supports
  `using reStructuredText
  <http://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/WikiRestructuredText>`__ as an
  alternative to wiki markup.

* PyLit_ provides a bidirectional text <--> code converter for *literate
  programming with reStructuredText*.

* If you are developing a Qt app, rst2qhc_ lets you generate the whole help
  automatically from reStructuredText. That includes keywords, TOC,
  multiple manuals per project, filters, project file, collection project
  file, and more.

  Can be converted to PDF slides with pdfLaTeX/XeLaTeX/LuaLaTeX.

* InkSlide_ quick and easy presentations using Inkscape_. InkSlide uses
  reStructuredText for markup, although it renders only a subset of rst.

* rst2outline_ translates a reStructuredText document to a plain text
  outline. This can then be transformed to PowerPoint.

* Pandoc_ can also be used to produce slides, as shown in this
  `Pandoc Slides Demo`_
