Future changes
==============

* Drop support for Python 2.4, 2.5, 3.1, and 3.2 immediately after the 0.14
  release.

* Remove the `handle_io_errors` option from io.FileInput/Output.
  Used by Sphinx up to version 1.3.1, fixed in 1.3.2 (Nov 29, 2015).

* The default HTML writer "html" with frontend ``rst2html.py`` may change
  from "html4css1" to "html5".

  Use `get_writer_by_name('html')` or the rst2html.py_ front end, if you
  want the output to be up-to-date automatically.

  Use a specific writer name or front end, if you depend on stability of the
  generated HTML code, e.g. because you use a custom style sheet or
  post-processing that may break otherwise.

Release 0.14 (2017-08-03)
=========================

As rc2.

* docutils/docs/ref/docutils.dtd:

  - Enable validation of Docutils XML documents against the DTD:

* docutils/parsers/rst/:

  - Added functionality: escaped whitespace in URI contexts.
  - Consistent handling of all whitespace characters in inline markup
    recognition. (May break documents that relied on some whitespace
    characters (NBSP, ...) *not* to be recognized as whitespace.)

* docutils/utils/smartquotes.py:

  - Update quote definitions for et, fi, fr, ro, sv, tr, uk.
  - Add quote definitions for hr, hsb, hu, lv, sh, sl, sr.
  - Differentiate apostrophe from closing single quote (if possible).
  - Add command line interface for stand-alone use (requires 2.7).

* docutils/writers/_html_base:

  - Provide default title in metadata.
  - The MathJax CDN shut down on April 30, 2017. For security reasons, we
    don't use a third party public installation as default but warn
    if `math-output` is set to MathJax without specifying a URL.
    See math-output_ for details.

* docutils/writers/html4css1:

  - Respect automatic table column sizing.

* docutils/writers/latex2e/__init__.py

  - Handle class arguments for block-level elements by wrapping them
    in a "DUclass" environment. This replaces the special handling for
    "epigraph" and "topic" elements.

* docutils/writers/odf_odt:

  - Language option sets ODF document's default language
  - Image width, scale, ... set image size in generated ODF.

* tools/

  - New front-end ``rst2html4.py``.


Release 0.13.1 (2016-12-09)
===========================

* docutils/writers/html5_polyglot

  - New HTML writer generating `HTML 5`_.

  .. _HTML 5: http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/

* tools/

  - New front-end ``rst2html5.py``.

* languages: persian/farsi (fa) and latvian (la) mappings.

* change default base url for :rfc: to http://tools.ietf.org/html/

* tables accept widths, a list and align

* latex2e: Fix admonition width, remove deprecated options,
  better tablewidth auto, ...

* rst.el: The problem with ``electric-indent-mode`` has been fixed.


Release 0.12 (2014-07-06)
=========================

Small changes only, release current state


Release 0.11 (2013-07-22)
=========================

* General

  - Apply [ 2714873 ] Fix for the overwritting of document attributes.
  - Support embedded aliases within hyperlink references.
  - Fix [ 228 ] try local import of docutils components (reader, writer, parser,
    language module) before global search.

* docutils/parsers/rst/directives/tables.py

  - Fix [ 210 ] Python 3.3 checks CVS syntax only if "strict" is True.

* docutils/writers/html4css1/__init__.py
  - Fix [ 3600051 ] for tables in a list, table cells are not compacted.
  - New setting `stylesheet_dirs` (see above).

    Now, it is easy to add a custom stylesheet to Docutils' default
    stylesheet with, e.g., ``--stylesheet_path='html4css1.css, mystyle.css'``

    Changed behaviour of the default settings:
      if there is a file ``html4css1.css`` in the working directory of the
      process at launch, it is used instead of the one provided by Docutils
      in the writer source directory.

  - New default for math-output_: ``HTML math.css``.
  - Avoid repeated class declarations in html4css1 writer
    (modified version of patch [ 104 ]).

.. _math-output: docs/user/config.html#math-output

* docutils/writers/latex2e/__init__.py

  - Drop the simple algorithm replacing straight double quotes with
    English typographic ones.
    Activate the SmartQuotes_ transform if you want this feature.
  - New setting `stylesheet_dirs`: Comma-separated list of directories
    where stylesheets are found. Used by `stylesheet_path` when expanding
    relative path arguments.

.. _SmartQuotes: docs/user/config.html#smart-quotes

* docutils/writers/manpage.py

  - Fix [3607063] handle lines starting with a period.

Release 0.10 (2012-12-16)
=========================

.. Note::

   Docutils 0.9.x is the last version supporting Python 2.3.

   Docutils 0.10 is compatible with Python versions from 2.4 to 3.2
   (cf. `Python 3 compatibility`_).

* General:

  - SmartQuotes transform for typographic quotes and dashes.

  - ``docutils/math``, ``docutils/error_reporting.py``, and
    ``docutils/urischemes.py`` moved to the utils package.
    Code importing these modules needs to adapt, e.g.::

      try:
          import docutils.math as math
      except ImportError:
          import docutils.utils.math as math

  - enhanced math and error handling.

* docutils/io.py

  - FileInput/FileOutput: no system-exit on IOError.
    The `handle_io_errors` option is ignored.

.. _Python 3 compatibility: README.html#python-3-compatibility

  - Use ``<code>`` tag for inline "code",
    do not drop nested inline nodes (syntax highlight tokens).

    installed in the PYTHONPATH. Converted tests are now
    stored in ``docutils/test3/``, tools no longer need conversion.

    If you installed one of Docutils versions 0.7 ... 0.9 with
    ``setup.py install`` under Python 3, remove the spurious
    ``test/`` and ``tools/`` directories in the site library root.


Release 0.9 (2012-05-02)
=========================

      .. _figure name:

      .. figure:: image.png

========================

.. Note::

   Docutils 0.5 is the last version supporting Python 2.2.

   Docutils 0.6 is compatible with Python versions from 2.3 up to 2.6
   and convertible to 3.1 code.

.. note::

   The "newlatex" writer is orphaned.

   The recommended way to generate PDF output is to use either the
   LaTeX2e writer or one of the alternatives listed at
   http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/user/links.html#pdf.

* reStructuredText:

  - Allow length units for all length specifications.
  - Allow percent sign in "scale" argument of "figure" and "image" directives.
  - Bugfix: The "figalign" argument of a figure now works as intended
    (aligning the figure not its contents).
  - Align images with class "align-[right|center|left]"
    (allows setting the alignment of an image in a figure).
  - Hard tabs in literal inclusions are replaced by spaces. This is
    configurable via the new "tab-width" option of the "include" directive
    (a negative tab-width prevents tab expansion).

* HTML writer:

  - ``--stylesheet`` and ``--stylesheet-path`` options now support a comma
    separated list of stylesheets.

    - use-latex-footnotes: true (no mixup with figures).
    - Float placement defaults to "here definitely" (configurable).
    - Align of image in a figure defaults to 'center'.
    - Use class defaults for page margins ('typearea' now optional).
  - Support LaTeX packages as ``--stylesheet`` arguments.

  - Do not use 'ae' and 'aeguill' packages if font-encoding is set to ''.
  - Set sub- and superscript role argument as text not math.
  - Support custom roles based on standard roles.
  - Load packages and define macros only if required in the document.
  - All Docutils specific LaTeX macros are prefixed with ``DU``.
  - Better conformance to Docutils specifications with "use_latex_toc".
  - If 'sectnum_xform' is False, the 'sectnum' directive triggers
    section numbering by LaTeX.
  - Use default font in admonitions and sidebar.
  - Typeset generic topic as "quote with title".
  - Use template (file and configuration option).
  - Render doctest blocks as literal blocks (indented).
