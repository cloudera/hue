# changelog

## 0.24.0

 - `x509.Certificate().self_signed` will no longer return `"yes"` under any
   circumstances. This helps prevent confusion since the library does not
   verify the signature. Instead a library like oscrypto should be used
   to confirm if a certificate is self-signed.
 - Added various OIDs to `x509.KeyPurposeId()`
 - Added `x509.Certificate().private_key_usage_period_value`
 - Added structures for parsing common subject directory attributes for
   X.509 certificates, including `x509.SubjectDirectoryAttribute()`
 - Added `algos.AnyAlgorithmIdentifier()` for situations where an
   algorithm identifier may contain a digest, signed digest or encryption
   algorithm OID
 - Fixed a bug with `x509.Certificate().subject_directory_attributes_value`
   not returning the correct value
 - Fixed a bug where explicitly-tagged fields in a `core.Sequence()` would
   not function properly when the field had a default value
 - Fixed a bug with type checking in `pem.armor()`

## 0.23.0

 - Backwards compatibility break: the `tag_type`, `explicit_tag` and
   `explicit_class` attributes on `core.Asn1Value` no longer exist and were
   replaced by the `implicit` and `explicit` attributes. Field param dicts
   may use the new `explicit` and `implicit` keys, or the old `tag_type` and
   `tag` keys. The attribute changes will likely to have little to no impact
   since they were primarily an implementation detail.
 - Teletex strings used inside of X.509 certificates are now interpreted
   using Windows-1252 (a superset of ISO-8859-1). This enables compatibility
   with certificates generated by OpenSSL. Strict parsing of Teletex strings
   can be retained by using the `x509.strict_teletex()` context manager.
 - Added support for nested explicit tagging, supporting values that are
   defined with explicit tagging and then added as a field of another
   structure using explicit tagging.
 - Fixed a `UnicodeDecodeError` when trying to find the (optional) dependency
   OpenSSL on Python 2
 - Fixed `next_update` field of `crl.TbsCertList` to be optional
 - Added the `x509.Certificate.sha256_fingerprint` property
 - `x509.Certificate.ocsp_urls` and `x509.DistributionPoint.url` will now
   return `https://`, `ldap://` and `ldaps://` URLs in addition to `http://`.
 - Added CMS Attribute Protection definitions from RFC 6211
 - Added OIDs from RFC 6962

## 0.22.0

 - Added `parser.peek()`
 - Implemented proper support for BER-encoded indefinite length strings of
   all kinds - `core.BitString`, `core.OctetString` and all of the `core`
   classes that are natively represented as Python unicode strings
 - Fixed a bug with encoding LDAP URLs in `x509.URI`
 - Correct `x509.DNSName` to allow a leading `.`, such as when used with
   `x509.NameConstraints`
 - Fixed an issue with dumping the parsed contents of `core.Any` when
   explicitly tagged
 - Custom `setup.py clean` now accepts the short `-a` flag for compatibility

## 0.21.1

 - Fixed a regression where explicit tagging of a field containing a
   `core.Choice` would result in an incorrect header
 - Fixed a bug where an `IndexError` was being raised instead of a `ValueError`
   when a value was truncated to not include enough bytes for the header
 - Corrected the spec for the `value` field of `pkcs12.Attribute`
 - Added support for `2.16.840.1.113894.746875.1.1` OID to
   `pkcs12.AttributeType`

## 0.21.0

 - Added `core.load()` for loading standard, universal types without knowing
   the spec beforehand
 - Added a `strict` keyword arg to the various `load()` methods and functions in
   `core` that checks for trailing data and raises a `ValueError` when found
 - Added `asn1crypto.parser` submodule with `emit()` and `parse()` functions for
   low-level integration
 - Added `asn1crypto.version` for version introspection without side-effects
 - Added `algos.DSASignature`
 - Fixed a bug with the `_header` attribute of explicitly-tagged values only
   containing the explicit tag header instead of both the explicit tag header
   and the encapsulated value header

## 0.20.0

 - Added support for year 0
 - Added the OID for unique identifier to `x509.NameType`
 - Fixed a bug creating the native representation of a `core.BitString` with
   leading null bytes
 - Added a `.cast()` method to allow converting between different
   representations of the same data, e.g. `core.BitString` and
   `core.OctetBitString`

## 0.19.0

 - Force `algos.DigestAlgorithm` to encoding `parameters` as `Null` when the
   `algorithm` is `sha1`, `sha224`, `sha256`, `sha384` or `sha512` per RFC 4055
 - Resolved an issue where a BER-encoded indefinite-length value could not be
   properly parsed when embedded inside of a `core.Sequence` or `core.Set`
 - Fix `x509.Name.build()` to properly handle dotted OID type values
 - `core.Choice` can now be constructed from a single-element `dict` or a
   two-element `tuple` to allow for better usability when constructing values
   from native Python values
 - All `core` objects can now be passed to `print()` with an exception being
   raised

## 0.18.5

 - Don't fail importing if `ctypes` or `_ctypes` is not available

## 0.18.4

 - `core.Sequence` will now raise an exception when an unknown field is provided
 - Prevent `UnicodeDecodeError` on Python 2 when calling
   `core.OctetString.debug()`
 - Corrected the default value for the `hash_algorithm` field of
   `tsp.ESSCertIDv2`
 - Fixed a bug constructing a `cms.SignedData` object
 - Ensure that specific RSA OIDs are always paired with `parameters` set to
   `core.Null`

## 0.18.3

 - Fixed DER encoding of `core.BitString` when a `_map` is specified (i.e. a
   "named bit list") to omit trailing zero bits. This fixes compliance of
   various `x509` structures with RFC 5280.
 - Corrected a side effect in `keys.PrivateKeyInfo.wrap()` that would cause the
   original `keys.ECPrivateKey` structure to become corrupt
 - `core.IntegerOctetString` now correctly encodes the integer as an unsigned
   value when converting to bytes. Previously decoding was unsigned, but
   encoding was signed.
 - Fix `util.int_from_bytes()` on Python 2 to return `0` from an empty byte
   string

## 0.18.2

 - Allow `_perf` submodule to be removed from source tree when embedding

   attribute
 - `algos.SignedDigestAlgorithm` now ensures the `parameters` are set to
   `Null` when `algorithm` is `sha224_rsa`, `sha256_rsa`, `sha384_rsa` or
   `sha512_rsa`, per RFC 4055
 - Corrected the definition of `pdf.AdobeTimestamp` to mark the
   `requires_auth` field as optional
 - Add support for the OID `1.2.840.113549.1.9.16.2.14` to
   `cms.CMSAttributeType`

   `cms.AttributeCertificateV1` in `cms.CertificateChoices`

 - Add support for Windows XP
 - Added `core.ObjectIdentifier.dotted` attribute to always return dotted
   integer unicode string

   class methods to map dotted integer unicode strings to user-friendly unicode
   strings and back
 - Added various Apple OIDs to `x509.KeyPurposeId`

 - Fixed a bug with `x509.Certificate.issuer_alt_name_value` if it is the first
   extension queried

   `algos.KeyExchangeAlgorithmId` and `algos.DHParameters`.
 - Added DH public key support to `keys.PublicKeyInfo`,
   `keys.PublicKeyAlgorithm` and `keys.PublicKeyAlgorithmId`. New structures
   include `keys.DomainParameters` and `keys.ValidationParms`.

## 0.15.1

 - Fixed `cms.CMSAttributes` to be a `core.SetOf` instead of `core.SequenceOf`
 - `cms.CMSAttribute` can now parse unknown attribute contrustruct without an
   exception being raised
 - `x509.PolicyMapping` now uses `x509.PolicyIdentifier` for field types
 - Fixed `pdf.RevocationInfoArchival` so that all fields are now of the type
   `core.SequenceOf` instead of a single value
 - Added support for the `name_distinguisher`, `telephone_number` and
   `organization_identifier` OIDs to `x509.Name`

   is the opposite of the standard way of least-specific to most-specific.
 - `x509.NameType.human_friendly` no longer raises an exception when an
   unknown OID is encountered
 - Raise a `ValueError` when parsing a `core.Set` and an unknown field is
   encountered

 - Changed `algos.SignedDigestAlgorithmId` to use the preferred OIDs when
   mapping a unicode string name to an OID. Previously there were multiple OIDs
   for some algorithms, and different OIDs would sometimes be selected due to
   the fact that the `_map` `dict` is not ordered.
