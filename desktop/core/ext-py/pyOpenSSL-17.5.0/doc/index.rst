=====================================
Welcome to pyOpenSSL's documentation!
=====================================

Release v\ |release| (:doc:`What's new? <changelog>`).

pyOpenSSL is a rather thin wrapper around (a subset of) the OpenSSL library.
With thin wrapper we mean that a lot of the object methods do nothing more than
calling a corresponding function in the OpenSSL library.
