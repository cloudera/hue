        djangosaml2 is a Django application that integrates the PySAML2 library
        into your project. This mean that you can protect your Django based project
        with a service provider based on PySAML. This way it will talk SAML2 with
        your Identity Provider allowing you to use this authentication mechanism.
        This document will guide you through a few simple steps to accomplish
        such goal.

        Installation
        ============
        
        PySAML2 uses xmlsec1_ binary to sign SAML assertions so you need to install
        it either through your operating system package or by compiling the source
        code. It doesn't matter where the final executable is installed because
        you will need to set the full path to it in the configuration stage.
        
        .. _xmlsec1: http://www.aleksey.com/xmlsec/
        
        Now you can install the djangosaml2 package using easy_install or pip. This
        will also install PySAML2 and its dependencies automatically.
        
        
        Configuration
        =============
        
        There are three things you need to setup to make djangosaml2 work in your
        Django project:
        
        1. **settings.py** as you may already know, it is the main Django
           configuration file.
        2. **urls.py** is the file where you will include djangosaml2 urls.
        3. **pysaml2** specific files such as an attribute map directory and a
           certificate.
        
        
        Changes in the settings.py file
        -------------------------------
        The first thing you need to do is add ``djangosaml2`` to the list of
        installed apps::
        
          INSTALLED_APPS = (
              'django.contrib.auth',
              'django.contrib.contenttypes',
              'django.contrib.sessions',
              'django.contrib.sites',
              'django.contrib.messages',
              'django.contrib.admin',
              'djangosaml2',  # new application
          )
        
        Actually this is not really required since djangosaml2 does not include
        any data model. The only reason we include it is to be able to run
        djangosaml2 test suite from our project, something you should always
        do to make sure it is compatible with your Django version and environment.
        
        .. note::
        
          When you finish the configuration you can run the djangosaml2 test suite as
          you run any other Django application test suite. Just type ``python manage.py
          test djangosaml2``.
        
          Python 2 users need to ``pip install djangosaml2[test]`` in order to run the
          tests.
        
        Then you have to add the ``djangosaml2.backends.Saml2Backend``
        authentication backend to the list of authentications backends.
        By default only the ModelBackend included in Django is configured.
        A typical configuration would look like this::
        
          AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS = (
              'django.contrib.auth.backends.ModelBackend',
              'djangosaml2.backends.Saml2Backend',
          )
        
        .. note::
        
          Before djangosaml2 0.5.0 this authentication backend was
          automatically added by djangosaml2. This turned out to be
          a bad idea since some applications want to use their own
          custom policies for authorization and the authentication
          backend is a good place to define that. Starting from
          djangosaml2 0.5.0 it is now possible to define such
          backends.
        
        Finally we have to tell Django what the new login url we want to use is::
        
          LOGIN_URL = '/saml2/login/'
          SESSION_EXPIRE_AT_BROWSER_CLOSE = True
        
        Here we are telling Django that any view that requires an authenticated
        user should redirect the user browser to that url if the user has not
        been authenticated before. We are also telling that when the user closes
        his browser, the session should be terminated. This is useful in SAML2
        federations where the logout protocol is not always available.
        
        .. note::
        
          The login url starts with ``/saml2/`` as an example but you can change that
          if you want. Check the section about changes in the ``urls.py``
          file for more information.
        
        If you want to allow several authentication mechanisms in your project
        you should set the LOGIN_URL option to another view and put a link in such
        view to the ``/saml2/login/`` view.
        
        Preferred Logout binding
        ------------------------
        Use the following setting to choose your preferred binding for SP initiated logout requests::
        
          SAML_LOGOUT_REQUEST_PREFERRED_BINDING
        
        For example::
        
          import saml2
          SAML_LOGOUT_REQUEST_PREFERRED_BINDING = saml2.BINDING_HTTP_POST
        
        Changes in the urls.py file
        ---------------------------
        
        The next thing you need to do is to include ``djangosaml2.urls`` module in your
        main ``urls.py`` module::
        
          urlpatterns = patterns(
              '',
              #  lots of url definitions here
        
              (r'^saml2/', include('djangosaml2.urls')),
        
              #  more url definitions
          )
        
        As you can see we are including ``djangosaml2.urls`` under the *saml2*
        prefix. Feel free to use your own prefix but be consistent with what
        you have put in the ``settings.py`` file in the LOGIN_URL parameter.
        
        
        PySAML2 specific files and configuration
        ----------------------------------------
        Once you have finished configuring your Django project you have to
        start configuring PySAML. If you use just that library you have to
        put your configuration options in a file and initialize PySAML2 with
        the path to that file.
        
        In djangosaml2 you just put the same information in the Django
        settings.py file under the SAML_CONFIG option.
        
        We will see a typical configuration for protecting a Django project::
        
          from os import path
          import saml2
          import saml2.saml
          BASEDIR = path.dirname(path.abspath(__file__))
          SAML_CONFIG = {
            # full path to the xmlsec1 binary programm
            'xmlsec_binary': '/usr/bin/xmlsec1',
        
            # your entity id, usually your subdomain plus the url to the metadata view
            'entityid': 'http://localhost:8000/saml2/metadata/',
        
            # directory with attribute mapping
            'attribute_map_dir': path.join(BASEDIR, 'attribute-maps'),
        
            # this block states what services we provide
            'service': {
                # we are just a lonely SP
                'sp' : {
                    'name': 'Federated Django sample SP',
                    'name_id_format': saml2.saml.NAMEID_FORMAT_PERSISTENT,
                    'endpoints': {
                        # url and binding to the assetion consumer service view
                        # do not change the binding or service name
                        'assertion_consumer_service': [
                            ('http://localhost:8000/saml2/acs/',
                             saml2.BINDING_HTTP_POST),
                            ],
                        # url and binding to the single logout service view

                            ('http://localhost:8000/saml2/ls/',

                            ('http://localhost:8000/saml2/ls/post',
                             saml2.BINDING_HTTP_POST),
                            ],
                        },

                },
            'valid_for': 24,  # how long is our metadata valid
            }
        
        .. note::
        
          Please check the `PySAML2 documentation`_ for more information about
          these and other configuration options.
        
        .. _`PySAML2 documentation`: http://pysaml2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
        
        There are several external files and directories you have to create according
        to this configuration.
        
        The xmlsec1 binary was mentioned in the installation section. Here, in the
        configuration part you just need to put the full path to xmlsec1 so PySAML2
        can call it as it needs.
        
        The ``attribute_map_dir`` points to a directory with attribute mappings that
        are used to translate user attribute names from several standards. It's usually
        safe to just copy the default PySAML2 attribute maps that you can find in the
        ``tests/attributemaps`` directory of the source distribution.
        
        The ``metadata`` option is a dictionary where you can define several types of
        metadata for remote entities. Usually the easiest type is the ``local`` where
        you just put the name of a local XML file with the contents of the remote
        entities metadata. This XML file should be in the SAML2 metadata format.
        
        The ``key_file`` and ``cert_file`` options reference the two parts of a
        standard x509 certificate. You need it to sign your metadata. For assertion
        encryption/decryption support please configure another set of ``key_file`` and
        ``cert_file``, but as inner attributes of ``encryption_keypairs`` option.
        
        .. note::
        
          Check your openssl documentation to generate a test certificate but don't
          forget to order a real one when you go into production.
        
        
        Custom and dynamic configuration loading
        ........................................
        
        By default, djangosaml2 reads the pysaml2 configuration options from the
        SAML_CONFIG setting but sometimes you want to read this information from
        another place, like a file or a database. Sometimes you even want this
        configuration to be different depending on the request.
        
        Starting from djangosaml2 0.5.0 you can define your own configuration
        loader which is a callable that accepts a request parameter and returns
        a saml2.config.SPConfig object. In order to do so you set the following
        setting::
        
          SAML_CONFIG_LOADER = 'python.path.to.your.callable'
        
        
        User attributes
        ---------------
        
        In the SAML 2.0 authentication process the Identity Provider (IdP) will
        send a security assertion to the Service Provider (SP) upon a successful
        authentication. This assertion contains attributes about the user that
        was authenticated. It depends on the IdP configuration what exact
        attributes are sent to each SP it can talk to.
        
        When such assertion is received on the Django side it is used to find a Django
        user and create a session for it. By default djangosaml2 will do a query on the
        User model with the USERNAME_FIELD_ attribute but you can change it to any
        other attribute of the User model. For example, you can do this lookup using
        the 'email' attribute. In order to do so you should set the following setting::
        
          SAML_DJANGO_USER_MAIN_ATTRIBUTE = 'email'
        
        .. _USERNAME_FIELD: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/auth/customizing/#django.contrib.auth.models.CustomUser.USERNAME_FIELD
        
        Please, use an unique attribute when setting this option. Otherwise
        the authentication process may fail because djangosaml2 will not know
        which Django user it should pick.
        
        If your main attribute is something inherently case-insensitive (such as
        an email address), you may set::
        
          SAML_DJANGO_USER_MAIN_ATTRIBUTE_LOOKUP = '__iexact'
        
        (This is simply appended to the main attribute name to form a Django
        query. Your main attribute must be unique even given this lookup.)
        
        Another option is to use the SAML2 name id as the username by setting::
        
          SAML_USE_NAME_ID_AS_USERNAME = True
        
        You can configure djangosaml2 to create such user if it is not already in
        the Django database or maybe you don't want to allow users that are not
        in your database already. For this purpose there is another option you
        can set in the settings.py file::
        
          SAML_CREATE_UNKNOWN_USER = True
        
        This setting is True by default.
        
          ACS_DEFAULT_REDIRECT_URL = reverse_lazy('some_url_name')
        
        This setting lets you specify a URL for redirection after a successful
        authentication. Particularly useful when you only plan to use
        IdP initiated login and the IdP does not have a configured RelayState
        parameter. The default is ``/``.
        
        The other thing you will probably want to configure is the mapping of
        SAML2 user attributes to Django user attributes. By default only the
        User.username attribute is mapped but you can add more attributes or
        change that one. In order to do so you need to change the
        SAML_ATTRIBUTE_MAPPING option in your settings.py::
        
          SAML_ATTRIBUTE_MAPPING = {
              'uid': ('username', ),
              'mail': ('email', ),
              'cn': ('first_name', ),
              'sn': ('last_name', ),
          }
        
        where the keys of this dictionary are SAML user attributes and the values
        are Django User attributes.
        
        If you are using Django user profile objects to store extra attributes
        about your user you can add those attributes to the SAML_ATTRIBUTE_MAPPING
        dictionary. For each (key, value) pair, djangosaml2 will try to store the
        attribute in the User model if there is a matching field in that model.
        Otherwise it will try to do the same with your profile custom model. For
        multi-valued attributes only the first value is assigned to the destination field.
        
        Alternatively, custom processing of attributes can be achieved by setting the
        value(s) in the SAML_ATTRIBUTE_MAPPING, to name(s) of method(s) defined on a
        custom django User object. In this case, each method is called by djangosaml2,
        passing the full list of attribute values extracted from the <saml:AttributeValue>
        elements of the <saml:Attribute>. Among other uses, this is a useful way to process
        multi-valued attributes such as lists of user group names.
        
        For example:
        
        Saml assertion snippet::
        
          <saml:Attribute Name="groups" NameFormat="urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:attrname-format:basic">
                <saml:AttributeValue>group1</saml:AttributeValue>
                <saml:AttributeValue>group2</saml:AttributeValue>
                <saml:AttributeValue>group3</saml:AttributeValue>
          </saml:Attribute>
        
        Custom User object::
        
          from django.contrib.auth.models import AbstractUser
        
          class User(AbstractUser):
        
            def process_groups(self, groups):
              // process list of group names in argument 'groups'
              pass;
        
        settings.py::
        
          SAML_ATTRIBUTE_MAPPING = {
              'groups': ('process_groups', ),
          }

        Sometimes you need to use special logic to update the user object
        depending on the SAML2 attributes and the mapping described above
        is simply not enough. For these cases djangosaml2 provides a Django
        signal that you can listen to. In order to do so you can add the
        following code to your app::
        
          from djangosaml2.signals import pre_user_save
        
          def custom_update_user(sender=User, instance, attributes, user_modified, **kargs)
             ...
             return True  # I modified the user object
        
        
        Your handler will receive the user object, the list of SAML attributes
        and a flag telling you if the user is already modified and need
        to be saved after your handler is executed. If your handler
        modifies the user object it should return True. Otherwise it should
        return False. This way djangosaml2 will know if it should save
        the user object so you don't need to do it and no more calls to
        the save method are issued.
        
        
        IdP setup
        =========
        Congratulations, you have finished configuring the SP side of the federation.
        Now you need to send the entity id and the metadata of this new SP to the
        IdP administrators so they can add it to their list of trusted services.
        
        You can get this information starting your Django development server and
        going to the http://localhost:8000/saml2/metadata url. If you have included
        the djangosaml2 urls under a different url prefix you need to correct this
        url.
        
        SimpleSAMLphp issues
        --------------------
        As of SimpleSAMLphp 1.8.2 there is a problem if you specify attributes in
        the SP configuration. When the SimpleSAMLphp metadata parser converts the
        XML into its custom php format it puts the following option::
        
          'attributes.NameFormat' => 'urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:attrname-format:uri'
        
        But it need to be replaced by this one::
        
          'AttributeNameFormat' => 'urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:attrname-format:uri'
        
        Otherwise the Assertions sent from the IdP to the SP will have a wrong
        Attribute Name Format and pysaml2 will be confused.
        
        Furthermore if you have a AttributeLimit filter in your SimpleSAMLphp
        configuration  you will need to enable another attribute filter just
        before to make sure that the AttributeLimit does not remove the attributes
        from the authentication source. The filter you need to add is an AttributeMap
        filter like this::
        
          10 => array(
                     'class' => 'core:AttributeMap', 'name2oid'
                ),
        
        Testing
        =======
        
        One way to check if everything is working as expected is to enable the
        following url::
        
          urlpatterns = patterns(
              '',
              #  lots of url definitions here
        
              (r'^saml2/', include('djangosaml2.urls')),
              (r'^test/', 'djangosaml2.views.echo_attributes'),
        
              #  more url definitions
          )
        
        
        Now if you go to the /test/ url you will see your SAML attributes and also
        a link to do a global logout.
        
        You can also run the unit tests with the following command::
        
          python tests/run_tests.py
        
        If you have `tox`_ installed you can simply call tox inside the root directory
        and it will run the tests in multiple versions of Python.
        
        .. _`tox`: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/tox
        
        FAQ
        ===
        
        **Why can't SAML be implemented as an Django Authentication Backend?**
        
        well SAML authentication is not that simple as a set of credentials you can
        put on a login form and get a response back. Actually the user password is
        not given to the service provider at all. This is by design. You have to
        delegate the task of authentication to the IdP and then get an asynchronous
        response from it.
        
        Given said that, djangosaml2 does use a Django Authentication Backend to
        transform the SAML assertion about the user into a Django user object.
        
        **Why not put everything in a Django middleware class and make our lifes
        easier?**
        
        Yes, that was an option I did evaluate but at the end the current design
        won. In my opinion putting this logic into a middleware has the advantage
        of making it easier to configure but has a couple of disadvantages: first,
        the middleware would need to check if the request path is one of the
        SAML endpoints for every request. Second, it would be too magical and in
        case of a problem, much harder to debug.
        
        **Why not call this package django-saml as many other Django applications?**
        
        Following that pattern then I should import the application with
        import saml but unfortunately that module name is already used in pysaml2.
