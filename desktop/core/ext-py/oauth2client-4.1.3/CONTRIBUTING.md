Here are some guidelines for hacking on `oauth2client`.

Before writing code, file an issue
----------------------------------

Use the [issue tracker][7] to start the discussion. It is possible that someone
else is already working on your idea, your approach is not quite right, or that
the functionality exists already. The ticket you file in the issue tracker will
be used to hash that all out.

Fork `oauth2client`
-------------------

We will use GitHub's mechanism for [forking][8] repositories and making pull
requests. Fork the repository, and make your changes in the forked repository.

Include tests
-------------

Be sure to add the relevant tests before making the pull request. Docs will be
updated automatically when we merge to `master`, but you should also build
the docs yourself via `tox -e docs` and make sure they're readable.

Make the pull request
---------------------

Once you have made all your changes, tests, and updated the documentation,
make a pull request to move everything back into the main `oauth2client`
repository. Be sure to reference the original issue in the pull request.
Expect some back-and-forth with regards to style and compliance of these
rules. In particular:
* `oauth2client` follows the [Google Python Style Guide][GooglePythonStyle].
* Follow [these guidelines][GitCommitRules] when authoring your commit message.

Using a Development Checkout
----------------------------

Youâ€™ll have to create a development environment to hack on
`oauth2client`, using a Git checkout:

-   While logged into your GitHub account, navigate to the `oauth2client`
    [repo][1] on GitHub.
-   Fork and clone the `oauth2client` repository to your GitHub account
    by clicking the "Fork" button.
-   Clone your fork of `oauth2client` from your GitHub account to your
    local computer, substituting your account username and specifying
    the destination as `hack-on-oauth2client`. For example:

    ```bash
    $ cd ${HOME}
    $ git clone git@github.com:USERNAME/oauth2client.git hack-on-oauth2client
    $ cd hack-on-oauth2client
    $ # Configure remotes such that you can pull changes from the oauth2client
    $ # repository into your local repository.
    $ git remote add upstream https://github.com:google/oauth2client
    $ # fetch and merge changes from upstream into master
    $ git fetch upstream
    $ git merge upstream/master
    ```

Now your local repo is set up such that you will push changes to your
GitHub repo, from which you can submit a pull request.

-   Create a virtualenv in which to install `oauth2client`:

    ```bash
    $ cd ~/hack-on-oauth2client
    $ virtualenv -ppython2.7 env
    ```

    Note that very old versions of virtualenv (virtualenv versions
    below, say, 1.10 or thereabouts) require you to pass a
    `--no-site-packages` flag to get a completely isolated environment.

    You can choose which Python version you want to use by passing a
    `-p` flag to `virtualenv`. For example, `virtualenv -ppython2.7`
    chooses the Python 2.7 interpreter to be installed.

    From here on in within these instructions, the
    `~/hack-on-oauth2client/env` virtual environment you created above will be
    referred to as `$VENV`. To use the instructions in the steps that
    follow literally, use the `export VENV=~/hack-on-oauth2client/env`
    command.

-   Install `oauth2client` from the checkout into the virtualenv using
    `setup.py develop`. Running `setup.py develop` **must** be done while
    the current working directory is the `oauth2client` checkout
    directory:

    ```bash
    $ cd ~/hack-on-oauth2client
    $ $VENV/bin/python setup.py develop
    ```

Running Tests
--------------

-   To run all tests for `oauth2client` on a single Python version, run
    `nosetests` from your development virtualenv (See
    **Using a Development Checkout** above).

-   To run the full set of `oauth2client` tests on all platforms, install
    [`tox`][2] into a system Python.  The `tox` console script will be
    installed into the scripts location for that Python.  While in the
    `oauth2client` checkout root directory (it contains `tox.ini`),
    invoke the `tox` console script.  This will read the `tox.ini` file and
    execute the tests on multiple Python versions and platforms; while it runs,
    it creates a virtualenv for each version/platform combination.  For
    example:

    ```bash
    $ sudo pip install tox
    $ cd ~/hack-on-oauth2client
    $ tox
    ```

-   In order to run the `pypy` environment (in `tox`) you'll need at
    least version 2.6 of `pypy` installed. See the [docs][13] for
    more information.

Running System Tests
--------------------

-   To run system tests you can execute:

    ```bash
    $ tox -e system-tests
    $ tox -e system-tests3
    ```

    This alone will not run the tests. You'll need to change some local
    auth settings and download some service account configuration files
    from your project to run all the tests.

-   System tests will be run against an actual project and so you'll need to
    provide some environment variables to facilitate this.

    -   `OAUTH2CLIENT_TEST_JSON_KEY_PATH`: The path to a service account JSON
        key file; see `tests/data/gcloud/application_default_credentials.json`
        as an example. Such a file can be downloaded directly from the
        developer's console by clicking "Generate new JSON key". See private
        key [docs][3] for more details.
    -   `OAUTH2CLIENT_TEST_P12_KEY_PATH`: The path to a service account
        P12/PKCS12 key file. You can download this in the same way as a JSON
        key, just select "P12 Key" as your "Key type" when downloading.
    -   `OAUTH2CLIENT_TEST_P12_KEY_EMAIL`: The service account email
        corresponding to the P12/PKCS12 key file.
    -   `OAUTH2CLIENT_TEST_USER_KEY_PATH`: The path to a JSON key file for a
        user. If this is not set, the file created by running
        `gcloud auth login` will be used. See
        `tests/data/gcloud/application_default_credentials_authorized_user.json`
        for an example.
    -   `OAUTH2CLIENT_TEST_USER_KEY_EMAIL`: The user account email
        corresponding to the user JSON key file.

-   Examples of these can be found in `scripts/local_test_setup.sample`. We
    recommend copying this to `scripts/local_test_setup`, editing the values
    and sourcing them into your environment:

    ```bash
    $ source scripts/local_test_setup
    ```
