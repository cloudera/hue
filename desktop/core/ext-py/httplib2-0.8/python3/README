httplib2 for Python 3

This directory contains a port of httplib2 to Python 3. As you may
know, Python 3 is not backward-compatible with Python 2. The biggest
change in Python 3 (that affects httplib2) is the distinction between
bytes and strings.

To successfully use http2lib for Python 3, you absolutely must
understand the following sentence:

** THE RESPONSE HEADERS ARE STRINGS, BUT THE CONTENT BODY IS BYTES **


Example:

>>> import httplib2, pprint
>>> h = httplib2.Http(".cache")
>>> (resp_headers, content) = h.request("http://example.org/", "GET")
>>> pprint.pprint(resp_headers)
{'accept-ranges': 'bytes',
 'connection': 'close',
 'content-length': '438',
 'content-location': 'http://example.org/',
 'content-type': 'text/html; charset=UTF-8',
 'date': 'Fri, 29 May 2009 03:57:29 GMT',
 'etag': '"b80f4-1b6-80bfd280"',
 'last-modified': 'Tue, 15 Nov 2005 13:24:10 GMT',
 'server': 'Apache/2.2.3 (CentOS)',
 'status': '200'}
>>> type(content)
<class 'bytes'>
>>> content[:49]
b'<HTML>\r\n<HEAD>\r\n  <TITLE>Example Web Page</TITLE>'
