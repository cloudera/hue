            Django's TransactionTestCase doesn't clean up the DB on teardown,
            but it's hard to guess whether subclasses (other than TestCase) do.
            We will assume they don't, unless they have a
            ``cleans_up_after_itself`` attr set to True. This is reasonable
            because the odd behavior of TransactionTestCase is documented, so
            subclasses should by default be assumed to preserve it.

            Thus, things will get these comparands (and run in this order):

            * 1: TestCase subclasses. These clean up after themselves.
            * 1: TransactionTestCase subclasses with

            * 2: TransactionTestCase subclasses. These leave a mess.
            * 2: Anything else (including doctests, I hope). These don't care
                 about the mess you left, because they don't hit the DB or, if
