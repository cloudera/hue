    If we were to traverse all the way to the leaves (the Tests)
    indiscriminately and return them, when the runner later calls them, they'd
    run without reference to the suite that contained them, so they'd miss
    their class-, module-, and package-wide setup and teardown routines.

    The nested suites form basically a double-linked tree, and suites will call
    up to their containing suites to run their setups and teardowns, but it
    would be hubris to assume that something you saw fit to setup or teardown
    at the module level is less costly to repeat than DB fixtures. Also, those
    sorts of setups and teardowns are extremely rare in our code. Thus, we
    limit the granularity of bucketing to the first level that has setups or
    teardowns.
