    """Test case that loads fixtures once and for all rather than once per test

    Using this can save huge swaths of time while still preserving test
    isolation. Fixture data is loaded at class setup time, and the transaction
    is committed. Commit and rollback methods are then monkeypatched away (like
    in Django's standard TestCase), and each test is run. After each test, the
    monkeypatching is temporarily undone, and a rollback is issued, returning
    the DB content to the pristine fixture state. Finally, upon class teardown,
    the DB is restored to a post-syncdb-like state by deleting the contents of
    any table that had been touched by a fixture (keeping infrastructure tables
    like django_content_type and auth_permission intact).

    Note that this is like Django's TestCase, not its TransactionTestCase, in
    that you cannot do your own commits or rollbacks from within tests.

    For best speed, group tests using the same fixtures into as few classes as
    possible. Better still, don't do that, and instead use the fixture-bundling
    plugin from django-nose, which does it dynamically at test time.
