Key derivation functions
========================

.. module:: cryptography.hazmat.primitives.kdf

Key derivation functions derive bytes suitable for cryptographic operations
from passwords or other data sources using a pseudo-random function (PRF).
Different KDFs are suitable for different tasks such as:

* Cryptographic key derivation

    Deriving a key suitable for use as input to an encryption algorithm.
    Typically this means taking a password and running it through an algorithm
    such as :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.kdf.pbkdf2.PBKDF2HMAC` or
    :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.kdf.hkdf.HKDF`.
    This process is typically known as `key stretching`_.

* Password storage

    When storing passwords you want to use an algorithm that is computationally
    intensive. Legitimate users will only need to compute it once (for example,
    taking the user's password, running it through the KDF, then comparing it
    to the stored value), while attackers will need to do it billions of times.
    Ideal password storage KDFs will be demanding on both computational and
    memory resources.

.. currentmodule:: cryptography.hazmat.primitives.kdf.pbkdf2

.. class:: PBKDF2HMAC(algorithm, length, salt, iterations, backend)

    .. versionadded:: 0.2

    `PBKDF2`_ (Password Based Key Derivation Function 2) is typically used for
    deriving a cryptographic key from a password. It may also be used for
    key storage, but an alternate key storage KDF such as `scrypt`_ is generally
    considered a better solution.

    This class conforms to the
    :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.kdf.KeyDerivationFunction`
    interface.

        provider.
    :param int length: The desired length of the derived key. Maximum is
        (2\ :sup:`32` - 1) * ``algorithm.digest_size``.
    :param bytes salt: A salt. `NIST SP 800-132`_ recommends 128-bits or
        longer.
    :param int iterations: The number of iterations to perform of the hash
        function. This can be used to control the length of time the operation
        takes. Higher numbers help mitigate brute force attacks against derived
        keys. See OWASP's `Password Storage Cheat Sheet`_ for more
        detailed recommendations if you intend to use this for password storage.

        provider.

    :raises cryptography.exceptions.UnsupportedAlgorithm: This is raised if the

        This generates and returns a new key from the supplied password.

        This checks whether deriving a new key from the supplied
        ``key_material`` generates the same key as the ``expected_key``, and
        raises an exception if they do not match. This can be used for
        checking whether the password a user provides matches the stored derived
        key.

    :param int length: The desired length of the derived key. Maximum is

    :param bytes salt: A salt. Randomizes the KDF's output. Optional, but
        highly recommended. Ideally as many bits of entropy as the security
        level of the hash: often that means cryptographically random and as
        long as the hash output. Worse (shorter, less entropy) salt values can
        still meaningfully contribute to security. May be reused. Does not have
        to be secret, but may cause stronger security guarantees if secret; see
        `RFC 5869`_ and the `HKDF paper`_ for more details. If ``None`` is

        highly recommended. Ideally as many bits of entropy as the security
        level of the hash: often that means cryptographically random and as
        long as the hash output. Does not have to be secret, but may cause
        stronger security guarantees if secret; If ``None`` is explicitly
        passed a default salt of ``algorithm.block_size`` null bytes will be
        used.

    :param bytes otherinfo: Application specific context information.
        If ``None`` is explicitly passed an empty byte string will be used.

.. class:: X963KDF(algorithm, length, otherinfo, backend)

    .. versionadded:: 1.1

    X963KDF (ANSI X9.63 Key Derivation Function) is defined by ANSI
    in the `ANSI X9.63:2001`_ document, to be used to derive keys for use
    after a Key Exchange negotiation operation.

    SECG in `SEC 1 v2.0`_ recommends that
    :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.kdf.concatkdf.ConcatKDFHash` be
    used for new projects. This KDF should only be used for backwards
    compatibility with pre-existing protocols.


    .. warning::

        X963KDF should not be used for password storage.
