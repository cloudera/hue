Message digests
===============

.. module:: cryptography.hazmat.primitives.hashes

.. class:: Hash(algorithm, backend)

    A cryptographic hash function takes an arbitrary block of data and
    calculates a fixed-size bit string (a digest), such that different data
    results (with a high probability) in different digests.

    This is an implementation of
    :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.hashes.HashContext` meant to
    be used with
    :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.hashes.HashAlgorithm`
    implementations to provide an incremental interface to calculating
    various message digests.

    .. doctest::

        >>> from cryptography.hazmat.backends import default_backend
        >>> from cryptography.hazmat.primitives import hashes
        >>> digest = hashes.Hash(hashes.SHA256(), backend=default_backend())
        >>> digest.update(b"abc")
        >>> digest.update(b"123")
        >>> digest.finalize()
        'l\xa1=R\xcap\xc8\x83\xe0\xf0\xbb\x10\x1eBZ\x89\xe8bM\xe5\x1d\xb2\xd29%\x93\xafj\x84\x11\x80\x90'

    If the backend doesn't support the requested ``algorithm`` an
    :class:`~cryptography.exceptions.UnsupportedAlgorithm` exception will be
    raised.

    Keep in mind that attacks against cryptographic hashes only get stronger
    with time, and that often algorithms that were once thought to be strong,
    become broken. Because of this it's important to include a plan for
    upgrading the hash algorithm you use over time. For more information, see
    `Lifetimes of cryptographic hash functions`_.

    :param algorithm: A
        :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.hashes.HashAlgorithm`
        provider such as those described in
        :ref:`below <cryptographic-hash-algorithms>`.
    :param backend: A
        :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.backends.interfaces.HashBackend`
        provider.

    :raises cryptography.exceptions.UnsupportedAlgorithm: This is raised if the
        provided ``backend`` does not implement
        :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.backends.interfaces.HashBackend`

    .. method:: update(data)

        :param bytes data: The bytes to be hashed.
        :raises cryptography.exceptions.AlreadyFinalized: See :meth:`finalize`.
        :raises TypeError: This exception is raised if ``data`` is not ``bytes``.

    .. method:: copy()

        Copy this :class:`Hash` instance, usually so that you may call
        :meth:`finalize` to get an intermediate digest value while we continue
        to call :meth:`update` on the original instance.

        :return: A new instance of :class:`Hash` that can be updated
             and finalized independently of the original instance.
        :raises cryptography.exceptions.AlreadyFinalized: See :meth:`finalize`.

    .. method:: finalize()

        Finalize the current context and return the message digest as bytes.

        After ``finalize`` has been called this object can no longer be used
        and :meth:`update`, :meth:`copy`, and :meth:`finalize` will raise an
        :class:`~cryptography.exceptions.AlreadyFinalized` exception.

        :return bytes: The message digest as bytes.
