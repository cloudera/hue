This is a very simple setup just to check that all your gear are in order.

The setup consists of one IdP and one SP, in idp2/ and sp-wsgi/ respectively.

To run the setup do:

  ./all.sh start

and then use your favourite webbrowser to look at "http://localhost:8087/"

To shut it down do:

  ./all.sh stop

The IdP authenticates users using a dictionary built in to idp2/idp.py;
look for the dictionary called PASSWD inside that file.

Other metadata about the accounts (names, email addresses, etc) are
stored in idp2/idp_user.py.  (Note, not all accounts have all such data
defined.)

The username:password pairs in PASSWD:

haho0032:qwerty
roland:dianakra
babs:howes
upper:crust

The SP doesn't do anything but show you the information that the IdP sent.

Note, the listeners are all configured to bind to localhost (127.0.0.1) only.
If you want to be able to connect to them externally, grep "HOST = '127.0.0.1'"
example/*/*.py and replace 127.0.0.1 with 0.0.0.0 or a specific IP.

To make it easy, for me :-), both the IdP and the SP uses the same keys.
To generate new keys, run create_key.sh and follow its instructions.

There are alternate IdP and SP configs in idp2_repoze/ and sp-repoze/ that
are still in flux; do not use them unless you know what you are doing.
