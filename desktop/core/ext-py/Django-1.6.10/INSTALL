Thanks for downloading Django.

To install it, make sure you have Python 2.6 or greater installed. Then run
this command from the command prompt:

    python setup.py install

If you're upgrading from a previous version, you need to remove it first.

AS AN ALTERNATIVE, you can just copy the entire "django" directory to Python's
site-packages directory, which is located wherever your Python installation
lives. Some places you might check are:

    /usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages (Unix, Python 2.7)
    /usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages (Unix, Python 2.6)
    C:\\PYTHON\site-packages         (Windows)

For more detailed instructions, see docs/intro/install.txt.
