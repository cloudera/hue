===================
Geographic Sitemaps
===================

Google's sitemap protocol used to include geospatial content support. [#]_
This included the addition of the ``<url>`` child element
``<geo:geo>``, which tells Google that the content located at the URL is
geographic in nature. This is now obsolete.
