.. warning::

    Be careful when you override settings, especially when the default value
    is a non-empty tuple or dictionary, such as :setting:`MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES`
    and :setting:`TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS`. Make sure you keep the
    components required by the features of Django you wish to use.

Core settings
=============

Here's a list of settings available in Django core and their default values.
Settings provided by contrib apps are listed below, followed by a topical index
of the core settings. For introductory material, see the :doc:`settings topic
guide </topics/settings>`.

.. setting:: ABSOLUTE_URL_OVERRIDES

ABSOLUTE_URL_OVERRIDES
----------------------

Default: ``{}`` (Empty dictionary)

A dictionary mapping ``"app_label.model_name"`` strings to functions that take
a model object and return its URL. This is a way of overriding
``get_absolute_url()`` methods on a per-installation basis. Example::

    ABSOLUTE_URL_OVERRIDES = {
        'blogs.weblog': lambda o: "/blogs/%s/" % o.slug,
        'news.story': lambda o: "/stories/%s/%s/" % (o.pub_year, o.slug),
    }

Note that the model name used in this setting should be all lower-case, regardless
of the case of the actual model class name.

.. setting:: ADMINS

ADMINS
------

Default: ``()`` (Empty tuple)

A tuple that lists people who get code error notifications. When
``DEBUG=False`` and a view raises an exception, Django will email these people
with the full exception information. Each member of the tuple should be a tuple
of (Full name, email address). Example::

    (('John', 'john@example.com'), ('Mary', 'mary@example.com'))

Note that Django will email *all* of these people whenever an error happens.
See :doc:`/howto/error-reporting` for more information.

.. setting:: ALLOWED_HOSTS

ALLOWED_HOSTS
-------------

Default: ``[]`` (Empty list)

A list of strings representing the host/domain names that this Django site can
serve. This is a security measure to prevent an attacker from poisoning caches
and password reset emails with links to malicious hosts by submitting requests
with a fake HTTP ``Host`` header, which is possible even under many
seemingly-safe web server configurations.

Values in this list can be fully qualified names (e.g. ``'www.example.com'``),
in which case they will be matched against the request's ``Host`` header
exactly (case-insensitive, not including port). A value beginning with a period
can be used as a subdomain wildcard: ``'.example.com'`` will match
``example.com``, ``www.example.com``, and any other subdomain of
``example.com``. A value of ``'*'`` will match anything; in this case you are
responsible to provide your own validation of the ``Host`` header (perhaps in a
middleware; if so this middleware must be listed first in
:setting:`MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES`).

.. note::

    If you want to also allow the `fully qualified domain name (FQDN)`_, which
    some browsers can send in the Host header, you must explicitly add another
    ALLOWED_HOSTS entry that includes a trailing period. This entry can also be
    a subdomain wildcard::

        ALLOWED_HOSTS = [
            '.example.com', # Allow domain and subdomains
            '.example.com.', # Also allow FQDN and subdomains
        ]

.. _`fully qualified domain name (FQDN)`: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fully_qualified_domain_name

If the ``Host`` header (or ``X-Forwarded-Host`` if
:setting:`USE_X_FORWARDED_HOST` is enabled) does not match any value in this
list, the :meth:`django.http.HttpRequest.get_host()` method will raise
:exc:`~django.core.exceptions.SuspiciousOperation`.

When :setting:`DEBUG` is ``True`` or when running tests, host validation is
disabled; any host will be accepted. Thus it's usually only necessary to set it
in production.

This validation only applies via :meth:`~django.http.HttpRequest.get_host()`;
if your code accesses the ``Host`` header directly from ``request.META`` you
are bypassing this security protection.

.. setting:: ALLOWED_INCLUDE_ROOTS

ALLOWED_INCLUDE_ROOTS
---------------------

Default: ``()`` (Empty tuple)

A tuple of strings representing allowed prefixes for the ``{% ssi %}`` template
tag. This is a security measure, so that template authors can't access files
that they shouldn't be accessing.

For example, if :setting:`ALLOWED_INCLUDE_ROOTS` is ``('/home/html', '/var/www')``,
then ``{% ssi /home/html/foo.txt %}`` would work, but ``{% ssi /etc/passwd %}``
wouldn't.

.. setting:: APPEND_SLASH

APPEND_SLASH
------------

Default: ``True``

When set to ``True``, if the request URL does not match any of the patterns
in the URLconf and it doesn't end in a slash, an HTTP redirect is issued to the
same URL with a slash appended. Note that the redirect may cause any data
submitted in a POST request to be lost.

The :setting:`APPEND_SLASH` setting is only used if
:class:`~django.middleware.common.CommonMiddleware` is installed
(see :doc:`/topics/http/middleware`). See also :setting:`PREPEND_WWW`.

.. setting:: CACHES

CACHES
------

Default::

    {
        'default': {
            'BACKEND': 'django.core.cache.backends.locmem.LocMemCache',
        }
    }

A dictionary containing the settings for all caches to be used with
Django. It is a nested dictionary whose contents maps cache aliases
to a dictionary containing the options for an individual cache.

The :setting:`CACHES` setting must configure a ``default`` cache;
any number of additional caches may also be specified. If you
are using a cache backend other than the local memory cache, or
you need to define multiple caches, other options will be required.
The following cache options are available.

.. setting:: CACHES-BACKEND

BACKEND
~~~~~~~

Default: ``''`` (Empty string)

The cache backend to use. The built-in cache backends are:

* ``'django.core.cache.backends.db.DatabaseCache'``
* ``'django.core.cache.backends.dummy.DummyCache'``
* ``'django.core.cache.backends.filebased.FileBasedCache'``
* ``'django.core.cache.backends.locmem.LocMemCache'``
* ``'django.core.cache.backends.memcached.MemcachedCache'``
* ``'django.core.cache.backends.memcached.PyLibMCCache'``

You can use a cache backend that doesn't ship with Django by setting
:setting:`BACKEND <CACHES-BACKEND>` to a fully-qualified path of a cache
backend class (i.e. ``mypackage.backends.whatever.WhateverCache``).
Writing a whole new cache backend from scratch is left as an exercise
to the reader; see the other backends for examples.

.. setting:: CACHES-KEY_FUNCTION

KEY_FUNCTION
~~~~~~~~~~~~

A string containing a dotted path to a function that defines how to
compose a prefix, version and key into a final cache key. The default
implementation is equivalent to the function::

    def make_key(key, key_prefix, version):
        return ':'.join([key_prefix, str(version), key])

You may use any key function you want, as long as it has the same
argument signature.

See the :ref:`cache documentation <cache_key_transformation>` for more
information.

.. setting:: CACHES-KEY_PREFIX

KEY_PREFIX
~~~~~~~~~~

Default: ``''`` (Empty string)

A string that will be automatically included (prepended by default) to
all cache keys used by the Django server.

See the :ref:`cache documentation <cache_key_prefixing>` for more information.

.. setting:: CACHES-LOCATION

LOCATION
~~~~~~~~

Default: ``''`` (Empty string)

The location of the cache to use. This might be the directory for a
file system cache, a host and port for a memcache server, or simply an
identifying name for a local memory cache. e.g.::

    CACHES = {
        'default': {
            'BACKEND': 'django.core.cache.backends.filebased.FileBasedCache',
            'LOCATION': '/var/tmp/django_cache',
        }
    }

.. setting:: CACHES-OPTIONS

OPTIONS
~~~~~~~

Default: None

Extra parameters to pass to the cache backend. Available parameters
vary depending on your cache backend.

Some information on available parameters can be found in the
:doc:`Cache Backends </topics/cache>` documentation. For more information,
consult your backend module's own documentation.

.. setting:: CACHES-TIMEOUT

TIMEOUT
~~~~~~~

Default: 300

The number of seconds before a cache entry is considered stale.

.. setting:: CACHES-VERSION

VERSION
~~~~~~~

Default: ``1``

The default version number for cache keys generated by the Django server.

See the :ref:`cache documentation <cache_versioning>` for more information.

.. setting:: CACHE_MIDDLEWARE_ALIAS

CACHE_MIDDLEWARE_ALIAS
----------------------

Default: ``default``

The cache connection to use for the :ref:`cache middleware
<the-per-site-cache>`.

.. setting:: CACHE_MIDDLEWARE_ANONYMOUS_ONLY

CACHE_MIDDLEWARE_ANONYMOUS_ONLY
-------------------------------

Default: ``False``

.. deprecated:: 1.6

    This setting was largely ineffective because of using cookies for sessions
    and CSRF. See the :doc:`Django 1.6 release notes</releases/1.6>` for more
    information.

If the value of this setting is ``True``, only anonymous requests (i.e., not
those made by a logged-in user) will be cached.  Otherwise, the middleware
caches every page that doesn't have GET or POST parameters.

If you set the value of this setting to ``True``, you should make sure you've
activated ``AuthenticationMiddleware``.

.. setting:: CACHE_MIDDLEWARE_KEY_PREFIX

CACHE_MIDDLEWARE_KEY_PREFIX
---------------------------

Default: ``''`` (Empty string)

A string which will be prefixed to the cache keys generated by the :ref:`cache
middleware <the-per-site-cache>`. This prefix is combined with the
:setting:`KEY_PREFIX <CACHES-KEY_PREFIX>` setting; it does not replace it.

See :doc:`/topics/cache`.

.. setting:: CACHE_MIDDLEWARE_SECONDS

CACHE_MIDDLEWARE_SECONDS
------------------------

Default: ``600``

The default number of seconds to cache a page for the :ref:`cache middleware
<the-per-site-cache>`.

See :doc:`/topics/cache`.

.. _settings-csrf:

.. setting:: CSRF_COOKIE_DOMAIN

CSRF_COOKIE_DOMAIN
------------------

Default: ``None``

The domain to be used when setting the CSRF cookie.  This can be useful for
easily allowing cross-subdomain requests to be excluded from the normal cross
site request forgery protection.  It should be set to a string such as
``".example.com"`` to allow a POST request from a form on one subdomain to be
accepted by a view served from another subdomain.

Please note that the presence of this setting does not imply that Django's CSRF
protection is safe from cross-subdomain attacks by default - please see the
:ref:`CSRF limitations <csrf-limitations>` section.

.. setting:: CSRF_COOKIE_HTTPONLY

CSRF_COOKIE_HTTPONLY
--------------------

.. versionadded:: 1.6

Default: ``False``

Whether to use ``HttpOnly`` flag on the CSRF cookie. If this is set to
``True``, client-side JavaScript will not to be able to access the CSRF cookie.
See :setting:`SESSION_COOKIE_HTTPONLY` for details on ``HttpOnly``.

.. setting:: CSRF_COOKIE_NAME

CSRF_COOKIE_NAME
----------------

Default: ``'csrftoken'``

The name of the cookie to use for the CSRF authentication token. This can be whatever you
want.  See :doc:`/ref/contrib/csrf`.

.. setting:: CSRF_COOKIE_PATH

CSRF_COOKIE_PATH
----------------

Default: ``'/'``

The path set on the CSRF cookie. This should either match the URL path of your
Django installation or be a parent of that path.

This is useful if you have multiple Django instances running under the same
hostname. They can use different cookie paths, and each instance will only see
its own CSRF cookie.

.. setting:: CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE

CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE
------------------

Default: ``False``

Whether to use a secure cookie for the CSRF cookie. If this is set to ``True``,
the cookie will be marked as "secure," which means browsers may ensure that the
cookie is only sent under an HTTPS connection.

.. setting:: CSRF_FAILURE_VIEW

CSRF_FAILURE_VIEW
-----------------

Default: ``'django.views.csrf.csrf_failure'``

A dotted path to the view function to be used when an incoming request
is rejected by the CSRF protection.  The function should have this signature::

  def csrf_failure(request, reason="")

where ``reason`` is a short message (intended for developers or logging, not for
end users) indicating the reason the request was rejected.  See
:doc:`/ref/contrib/csrf`.

.. setting:: DATABASES

DATABASES
---------

Default: ``{}`` (Empty dictionary)

A dictionary containing the settings for all databases to be used with
Django. It is a nested dictionary whose contents maps database aliases
to a dictionary containing the options for an individual database.

The :setting:`DATABASES` setting must configure a ``default`` database;
any number of additional databases may also be specified.

The simplest possible settings file is for a single-database setup using
SQLite. This can be configured using the following::

    DATABASES = {
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
            'NAME': 'mydatabase',
        }
    }

When connecting to other database backends, such as MySQL, Oracle, or
PostgreSQL, additional connection parameters will be required. See
the :setting:`ENGINE <DATABASE-ENGINE>` setting below on how to specify
other database types. This example is for PostgreSQL::

    DATABASES = {
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql_psycopg2',
            'NAME': 'mydatabase',
            'USER': 'mydatabaseuser',
            'PASSWORD': 'mypassword',
            'HOST': '127.0.0.1',
            'PORT': '5432',
        }
    }

The following inner options that may be required for more complex
configurations are available:

.. setting:: DATABASE-ATOMIC_REQUESTS

ATOMIC_REQUESTS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: 1.6

Default: ``False``

Set this to ``True`` to wrap each HTTP request in a transaction on this
database. See :ref:`tying-transactions-to-http-requests`.

.. setting:: DATABASE-AUTOCOMMIT

AUTOCOMMIT
~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: 1.6

Default: ``True``

Set this to ``False`` if you want to :ref:`disable Django's transaction
management <deactivate-transaction-management>` and implement your own.

.. setting:: DATABASE-ENGINE

ENGINE
~~~~~~

Default: ``''`` (Empty string)

The database backend to use. The built-in database backends are:

* ``'django.db.backends.postgresql_psycopg2'``
* ``'django.db.backends.mysql'``
* ``'django.db.backends.sqlite3'``
* ``'django.db.backends.oracle'``

You can use a database backend that doesn't ship with Django by setting
``ENGINE`` to a fully-qualified path (i.e.
``mypackage.backends.whatever``). Writing a whole new database backend from
scratch is left as an exercise to the reader; see the other backends for
examples.

.. setting:: HOST

HOST
~~~~

Default: ``''`` (Empty string)

Which host to use when connecting to the database. An empty string means
localhost. Not used with SQLite.

If this value starts with a forward slash (``'/'``) and you're using MySQL,
MySQL will connect via a Unix socket to the specified socket. For example::

    "HOST": '/var/run/mysql'

If you're using MySQL and this value *doesn't* start with a forward slash, then
this value is assumed to be the host.

If you're using PostgreSQL, by default (empty :setting:`HOST`), the connection
to the database is done through UNIX domain sockets ('local' lines in
``pg_hba.conf``). If your UNIX domain socket is not in the standard location,
use the same value of ``unix_socket_directory`` from ``postgresql.conf``.
If you want to connect through TCP sockets, set :setting:`HOST` to 'localhost'
or '127.0.0.1' ('host' lines in ``pg_hba.conf``).
On Windows, you should always define :setting:`HOST`, as UNIX domain sockets
are not available.

.. setting:: NAME

NAME
~~~~

Default: ``''`` (Empty string)

The name of the database to use. For SQLite, it's the full path to the database
file. When specifying the path, always use forward slashes, even on Windows
(e.g. ``C:/homes/user/mysite/sqlite3.db``).

.. setting:: CONN_MAX_AGE

CONN_MAX_AGE
~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: 1.6

Default: ``0``

The lifetime of a database connection, in seconds. Use ``0`` to close database
connections at the end of each request — Django's historical behavior — and
``None`` for unlimited persistent connections.

.. setting:: OPTIONS

OPTIONS
~~~~~~~

Default: ``{}`` (Empty dictionary)

Extra parameters to use when connecting to the database. Available parameters
vary depending on your database backend.

Some information on available parameters can be found in the
:doc:`Database Backends </ref/databases>` documentation. For more information,
consult your backend module's own documentation.

.. setting:: PASSWORD

PASSWORD
~~~~~~~~

Default: ``''`` (Empty string)

The password to use when connecting to the database. Not used with SQLite.

.. setting:: PORT

PORT
~~~~

Default: ``''`` (Empty string)

The port to use when connecting to the database. An empty string means the
default port. Not used with SQLite.

.. setting:: USER

USER
~~~~

Default: ``''`` (Empty string)

The username to use when connecting to the database. Not used with SQLite.

.. setting:: TEST_CHARSET

TEST_CHARSET
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Default: ``None``

The character set encoding used to create the test database. The value of this
string is passed directly through to the database, so its format is
backend-specific.

Supported for the PostgreSQL_ (``postgresql_psycopg2``) and MySQL_ (``mysql``)
backends.

.. _PostgreSQL: http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/multibyte.html
.. _MySQL: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/charset-database.html

.. setting:: TEST_COLLATION

TEST_COLLATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Default: ``None``

The collation order to use when creating the test database. This value is
passed directly to the backend, so its format is backend-specific.

Only supported for the ``mysql`` backend (see the `MySQL manual`_ for details).

.. _MySQL manual: MySQL_

.. setting:: TEST_DEPENDENCIES

TEST_DEPENDENCIES
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Default: ``['default']``, for all databases other than ``default``,
which has no dependencies.

The creation-order dependencies of the database. See the documentation
on :ref:`controlling the creation order of test databases
<topics-testing-creation-dependencies>` for details.

.. setting:: TEST_MIRROR

TEST_MIRROR
~~~~~~~~~~~

Default: ``None``

The alias of the database that this database should mirror during
testing.

This setting exists to allow for testing of master/slave
configurations of multiple databases. See the documentation on
:ref:`testing master/slave configurations
<topics-testing-masterslave>` for details.

.. setting:: TEST_NAME

TEST_NAME
~~~~~~~~~

Default: ``None``

The name of database to use when running the test suite.

If the default value (``None``) is used with the SQLite database engine, the
tests will use a memory resident database. For all other database engines the
test database will use the name ``'test_' + DATABASE_NAME``.

See :ref:`the-test-database`.

.. setting:: TEST_CREATE

TEST_CREATE
~~~~~~~~~~~

Default: ``True``

This is an Oracle-specific setting.

If it is set to ``False``, the test tablespaces won't be automatically created
at the beginning of the tests and dropped at the end.

.. setting:: TEST_USER

TEST_USER
~~~~~~~~~

Default: ``None``

This is an Oracle-specific setting.

The username to use when connecting to the Oracle database that will be used
when running tests. If not provided, Django will use ``'test_' + USER``.

.. setting:: TEST_USER_CREATE

TEST_USER_CREATE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Default: ``True``

This is an Oracle-specific setting.

If it is set to ``False``, the test user won't be automatically created at the
beginning of the tests and dropped at the end.

.. setting:: TEST_PASSWD

TEST_PASSWD
~~~~~~~~~~~

Default: ``None``

This is an Oracle-specific setting.

The password to use when connecting to the Oracle database that will be used
when running tests. If not provided, Django will use a hardcoded default value.

.. setting:: TEST_TBLSPACE

TEST_TBLSPACE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Default: ``None``

This is an Oracle-specific setting.

The name of the tablespace that will be used when running tests. If not
provided, Django will use ``'test_' + NAME``.

.. setting:: TEST_TBLSPACE_TMP

TEST_TBLSPACE_TMP
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Default: ``None``

This is an Oracle-specific setting.

The name of the temporary tablespace that will be used when running tests. If
not provided, Django will use ``'test_' + NAME + '_temp'``.

.. setting:: DATABASE_ROUTERS

DATABASE_ROUTERS
----------------

Default: ``[]`` (Empty list)

The list of routers that will be used to determine which database
to use when performing a database queries.

See the documentation on :ref:`automatic database routing in multi
database configurations <topics-db-multi-db-routing>`.

.. setting:: DATE_FORMAT

DATE_FORMAT
-----------

Default: ``'N j, Y'`` (e.g. ``Feb. 4, 2003``)

The default formatting to use for displaying date fields in any part of the
system. Note that if :setting:`USE_L10N` is set to ``True``, then the
locale-dictated format has higher precedence and will be applied instead. See
:tfilter:`allowed date format strings <date>`.

See also :setting:`DATETIME_FORMAT`, :setting:`TIME_FORMAT` and :setting:`SHORT_DATE_FORMAT`.

.. setting:: DATE_INPUT_FORMATS

DATE_INPUT_FORMATS
------------------

Default::

    (
        '%Y-%m-%d', '%m/%d/%Y', '%m/%d/%y', # '2006-10-25', '10/25/2006', '10/25/06'
        '%b %d %Y', '%b %d, %Y',            # 'Oct 25 2006', 'Oct 25, 2006'
        '%d %b %Y', '%d %b, %Y',            # '25 Oct 2006', '25 Oct, 2006'
        '%B %d %Y', '%B %d, %Y',            # 'October 25 2006', 'October 25, 2006'
        '%d %B %Y', '%d %B, %Y',            # '25 October 2006', '25 October, 2006'
    )

A tuple of formats that will be accepted when inputting data on a date field.
Formats will be tried in order, using the first valid one. Note that these
format strings use Python's datetime_ module syntax, not the format strings
from the ``date`` Django template tag.

When :setting:`USE_L10N` is ``True``, the locale-dictated format has higher
precedence and will be applied instead.

See also :setting:`DATETIME_INPUT_FORMATS` and :setting:`TIME_INPUT_FORMATS`.

.. _datetime: http://docs.python.org/library/datetime.html#strftime-strptime-behavior

.. setting:: DATETIME_FORMAT

DATETIME_FORMAT
---------------

Default: ``'N j, Y, P'`` (e.g. ``Feb. 4, 2003, 4 p.m.``)

The default formatting to use for displaying datetime fields in any part of the
system. Note that if :setting:`USE_L10N` is set to ``True``, then the
locale-dictated format has higher precedence and will be applied instead. See
:tfilter:`allowed date format strings <date>`.

See also :setting:`DATE_FORMAT`, :setting:`TIME_FORMAT` and :setting:`SHORT_DATETIME_FORMAT`.

.. setting:: DATETIME_INPUT_FORMATS

DATETIME_INPUT_FORMATS
----------------------

Default::

    (
        '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S',     # '2006-10-25 14:30:59'
        '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S.%f',  # '2006-10-25 14:30:59.000200'
        '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M',        # '2006-10-25 14:30'
        '%Y-%m-%d',              # '2006-10-25'

        '%m/%d/%y %H:%M',        # '10/25/06 14:30'
        '%m/%d/%y',              # '10/25/06'
    )

A tuple of formats that will be accepted when inputting data on a datetime
field. Formats will be tried in order, using the first valid one. Note that
these format strings use Python's datetime_ module syntax, not the format
strings from the ``date`` Django template tag.

When :setting:`USE_L10N` is ``True``, the locale-dictated format has higher
precedence and will be applied instead.

See also :setting:`DATE_INPUT_FORMATS` and :setting:`TIME_INPUT_FORMATS`.

.. _datetime: http://docs.python.org/library/datetime.html#strftime-strptime-behavior

.. setting:: DEBUG

DEBUG
-----

Default: ``False``

A boolean that turns on/off debug mode.

Never deploy a site into production with :setting:`DEBUG` turned on.

Did you catch that? NEVER deploy a site into production with :setting:`DEBUG`
turned on.

One of the main features of debug mode is the display of detailed error pages.
If your app raises an exception when :setting:`DEBUG` is ``True``, Django will
display a detailed traceback, including a lot of metadata about your
environment, such as all the currently defined Django settings (from
``settings.py``).

As a security measure, Django will *not* include settings that might be
sensitive (or offensive), such as :setting:`SECRET_KEY` or
:setting:`PROFANITIES_LIST`. Specifically, it will exclude any setting whose
name includes any of the following:

* ``'API'``
* ``'KEY'``
* ``'PASS'``
* ``'PROFANITIES_LIST'``
* ``'SECRET'``
* ``'SIGNATURE'``
* ``'TOKEN'``

Note that these are *partial* matches. ``'PASS'`` will also match PASSWORD,
just as ``'TOKEN'`` will also match TOKENIZED and so on.

Still, note that there are always going to be sections of your debug output
that are inappropriate for public consumption. File paths, configuration
options and the like all give attackers extra information about your server.

It is also important to remember that when running with :setting:`DEBUG`
turned on, Django will remember every SQL query it executes. This is useful
when you're debugging, but it'll rapidly consume memory on a production server.

Finally, if :setting:`DEBUG` is ``False``, you also need to properly set
the :setting:`ALLOWED_HOSTS` setting. Failing to do so will result in all
requests being returned as "Bad Request (400)".

.. _django/views/debug.py: https://github.com/django/django/blob/master/django/views/debug.py

.. setting:: DEBUG_PROPAGATE_EXCEPTIONS

DEBUG_PROPAGATE_EXCEPTIONS
--------------------------

Default: ``False``

If set to True, Django's normal exception handling of view functions
will be suppressed, and exceptions will propagate upwards.  This can
be useful for some test setups, and should never be used on a live
site.

.. setting:: DECIMAL_SEPARATOR

DECIMAL_SEPARATOR
-----------------

Default: ``'.'`` (Dot)

Default decimal separator used when formatting decimal numbers.

Note that if :setting:`USE_L10N` is set to ``True``, then the locale-dictated
format has higher precedence and will be applied instead.

See also :setting:`NUMBER_GROUPING`, :setting:`THOUSAND_SEPARATOR` and
:setting:`USE_THOUSAND_SEPARATOR`.


.. setting:: DEFAULT_CHARSET

DEFAULT_CHARSET
---------------

Default: ``'utf-8'``

Default charset to use for all ``HttpResponse`` objects, if a MIME type isn't
manually specified. Used with :setting:`DEFAULT_CONTENT_TYPE` to construct the
``Content-Type`` header.

.. setting:: DEFAULT_CONTENT_TYPE

DEFAULT_CONTENT_TYPE
--------------------

Default: ``'text/html'``

Default content type to use for all ``HttpResponse`` objects, if a MIME type
isn't manually specified. Used with :setting:`DEFAULT_CHARSET` to construct
the ``Content-Type`` header.

.. setting:: DEFAULT_EXCEPTION_REPORTER_FILTER

DEFAULT_EXCEPTION_REPORTER_FILTER
---------------------------------

Default: :class:`django.views.debug.SafeExceptionReporterFilter`

Default exception reporter filter class to be used if none has been assigned to
the :class:`~django.http.HttpRequest` instance yet.
See :ref:`Filtering error reports<filtering-error-reports>`.

.. setting:: DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE

DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE
--------------------

Default: :class:`django.core.files.storage.FileSystemStorage`

Default file storage class to be used for any file-related operations that don't
specify a particular storage system. See :doc:`/topics/files`.

.. setting:: DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL

DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL
------------------

Default: ``'webmaster@localhost'``

Default email address to use for various automated correspondence from the
site manager(s). This doesn't include error messages sent to :setting:`ADMINS`
and :setting:`MANAGERS`; for that, see :setting:`SERVER_EMAIL`.

.. setting:: DEFAULT_INDEX_TABLESPACE

DEFAULT_INDEX_TABLESPACE
------------------------

Default: ``''`` (Empty string)

Default tablespace to use for indexes on fields that don't specify
one, if the backend supports it (see :doc:`/topics/db/tablespaces`).

.. setting:: DEFAULT_TABLESPACE

DEFAULT_TABLESPACE
------------------

Default: ``''`` (Empty string)

Default tablespace to use for models that don't specify one, if the
backend supports it (see :doc:`/topics/db/tablespaces`).

.. setting:: DISALLOWED_USER_AGENTS

DISALLOWED_USER_AGENTS
----------------------

Default: ``()`` (Empty tuple)

List of compiled regular expression objects representing User-Agent strings that
are not allowed to visit any page, systemwide. Use this for bad robots/crawlers.
This is only used if ``CommonMiddleware`` is installed (see
:doc:`/topics/http/middleware`).

.. setting:: EMAIL_BACKEND

EMAIL_BACKEND
-------------

Default: ``'django.core.mail.backends.smtp.EmailBackend'``

The backend to use for sending emails. For the list of available backends see
:doc:`/topics/email`.

.. setting:: EMAIL_FILE_PATH

EMAIL_FILE_PATH
---------------

Default: Not defined

The directory used by the ``file`` email backend to store output files.

.. setting:: EMAIL_HOST

EMAIL_HOST
----------

Default: ``'localhost'``

The host to use for sending email.

See also :setting:`EMAIL_PORT`.

.. setting:: EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD

EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD
-------------------

Default: ``''`` (Empty string)

Password to use for the SMTP server defined in :setting:`EMAIL_HOST`. This
setting is used in conjunction with :setting:`EMAIL_HOST_USER` when
authenticating to the SMTP server. If either of these settings is empty,
Django won't attempt authentication.

See also :setting:`EMAIL_HOST_USER`.

.. setting:: EMAIL_HOST_USER

EMAIL_HOST_USER
---------------

Default: ``''`` (Empty string)

Username to use for the SMTP server defined in :setting:`EMAIL_HOST`.
If empty, Django won't attempt authentication.

See also :setting:`EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD`.

.. setting:: EMAIL_PORT

EMAIL_PORT
----------

Default: ``25``

Port to use for the SMTP server defined in :setting:`EMAIL_HOST`.

.. setting:: EMAIL_SUBJECT_PREFIX

EMAIL_SUBJECT_PREFIX
--------------------

Default: ``'[Django] '``

Subject-line prefix for email messages sent with ``django.core.mail.mail_admins``
or ``django.core.mail.mail_managers``. You'll probably want to include the
trailing space.

.. setting:: EMAIL_USE_TLS

EMAIL_USE_TLS
-------------

Default: ``False``

Whether to use a TLS (secure) connection when talking to the SMTP server.

.. setting:: FILE_CHARSET

FILE_CHARSET
------------

Default: ``'utf-8'``

The character encoding used to decode any files read from disk. This includes
template files and initial SQL data files.

.. setting:: FILE_UPLOAD_HANDLERS

FILE_UPLOAD_HANDLERS
--------------------

Default::

    ("django.core.files.uploadhandler.MemoryFileUploadHandler",
     "django.core.files.uploadhandler.TemporaryFileUploadHandler",)

A tuple of handlers to use for uploading. See :doc:`/topics/files` for details.

.. setting:: FILE_UPLOAD_MAX_MEMORY_SIZE

FILE_UPLOAD_MAX_MEMORY_SIZE
---------------------------

Default: ``2621440`` (i.e. 2.5 MB).

The maximum size (in bytes) that an upload will be before it gets streamed to
the file system. See :doc:`/topics/files` for details.

.. setting:: FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS

FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS
-----------------------

Default: ``None``

The numeric mode (i.e. ``0o644``) to set newly uploaded files to. For
more information about what these modes mean, see the documentation for
:func:`os.chmod`.

If this isn't given or is ``None``, you'll get operating-system
dependent behavior. On most platforms, temporary files will have a mode
of ``0o600``, and files saved from memory will be saved using the
system's standard umask.

.. warning::

    **Always prefix the mode with a 0.**

    If you're not familiar with file modes, please note that the leading
    ``0`` is very important: it indicates an octal number, which is the
    way that modes must be specified. If you try to use ``644``, you'll
    get totally incorrect behavior.


.. setting:: FILE_UPLOAD_TEMP_DIR

FILE_UPLOAD_TEMP_DIR
--------------------

Default: ``None``

The directory to store data temporarily while uploading files. If ``None``,
Django will use the standard temporary directory for the operating system. For
example, this will default to '/tmp' on \*nix-style operating systems.

See :doc:`/topics/files` for details.

.. setting:: FIRST_DAY_OF_WEEK

FIRST_DAY_OF_WEEK
-----------------

Default: ``0`` (Sunday)

Number representing the first day of the week. This is especially useful
when displaying a calendar. This value is only used when not using
format internationalization, or when a format cannot be found for the
current locale.

The value must be an integer from 0 to 6, where 0 means Sunday, 1 means
Monday and so on.

.. setting:: FIXTURE_DIRS

FIXTURE_DIRS
-------------

Default: ``()`` (Empty tuple)

List of directories searched for fixture files, in addition to the
``fixtures`` directory of each application, in search order.

Note that these paths should use Unix-style forward slashes, even on Windows.

See :ref:`initial-data-via-fixtures` and :ref:`topics-testing-fixtures`.

.. setting:: FORCE_SCRIPT_NAME

FORCE_SCRIPT_NAME
------------------

Default: ``None``

If not ``None``, this will be used as the value of the ``SCRIPT_NAME``
environment variable in any HTTP request. This setting can be used to override
the server-provided value of ``SCRIPT_NAME``, which may be a rewritten version
of the preferred value or not supplied at all.

.. setting:: FORMAT_MODULE_PATH

FORMAT_MODULE_PATH
------------------

Default: ``None``

A full Python path to a Python package that contains format definitions for
project locales. If not ``None``, Django will check for a ``formats.py``
file, under the directory named as the current locale, and will use the
formats defined on this file.

For example, if :setting:`FORMAT_MODULE_PATH` is set to ``mysite.formats``,
and current language is ``en`` (English), Django will expect a directory tree
like::

    mysite/
        formats/
            __init__.py
            en/
                __init__.py
                formats.py

Available formats are :setting:`DATE_FORMAT`, :setting:`TIME_FORMAT`,
:setting:`DATETIME_FORMAT`, :setting:`YEAR_MONTH_FORMAT`,
:setting:`MONTH_DAY_FORMAT`, :setting:`SHORT_DATE_FORMAT`,
:setting:`SHORT_DATETIME_FORMAT`, :setting:`FIRST_DAY_OF_WEEK`,
:setting:`DECIMAL_SEPARATOR`, :setting:`THOUSAND_SEPARATOR` and
:setting:`NUMBER_GROUPING`.

.. setting:: IGNORABLE_404_URLS

IGNORABLE_404_URLS
------------------

Default: ``()``

List of compiled regular expression objects describing URLs that should be
ignored when reporting HTTP 404 errors via email (see
:doc:`/howto/error-reporting`). Regular expressions are matched against
:meth:`request's full paths <django.http.HttpRequest.get_full_path>` (including
query string, if any). Use this if your site does not provide a commonly
requested file such as ``favicon.ico`` or ``robots.txt``, or if it gets
hammered by script kiddies.

This is only used if
:class:`~django.middleware.common.BrokenLinkEmailsMiddleware` is enabled (see
:doc:`/topics/http/middleware`).

.. setting:: INSTALLED_APPS

INSTALLED_APPS
--------------

Default: ``()`` (Empty tuple)

A tuple of strings designating all applications that are enabled in this Django
installation. Each string should be a full Python path to a Python package that
contains a Django application, as created by :djadmin:`django-admin.py startapp
<startapp>`.

.. admonition:: App names must be unique

    The application names (that is, the final dotted part of the
    path to the module containing ``models.py``) defined in
    :setting:`INSTALLED_APPS` *must* be unique. For example, you can't
    include both ``django.contrib.auth`` and ``myproject.auth`` in
    INSTALLED_APPS.

.. setting:: INTERNAL_IPS

INTERNAL_IPS
------------

Default: ``()`` (Empty tuple)

A tuple of IP addresses, as strings, that:

* See debug comments, when :setting:`DEBUG` is ``True``
* Receive X headers in admindocs if the ``XViewMiddleware`` is installed (see
  :doc:`/ref/contrib/admin/admindocs`)

.. setting:: LANGUAGE_CODE

LANGUAGE_CODE
-------------

Default: ``'en-us'``

A string representing the language code for this installation. This should be in
standard :term:`language ID format <language code>`. For example, U.S. English
is ``"en-us"``. See also the `list of language identifiers`_ and
:doc:`/topics/i18n/index`.

:setting:`USE_I18N` must be active for this setting to have any effect.

It serves two purposes:

* If the locale middleware isn't in use, it decides which translation is served
  to all users.
* If the locale middleware is active, it provides the fallback translation when
  no translation exist for a given literal to the user's preferred language.

See :ref:`how-django-discovers-language-preference` for more details.

.. _list of language identifiers: http://www.i18nguy.com/unicode/language-identifiers.html

.. setting:: LANGUAGE_COOKIE_NAME

LANGUAGE_COOKIE_NAME
--------------------

Default: ``'django_language'``

The name of the cookie to use for the language cookie. This can be whatever
you want (but should be different from :setting:`SESSION_COOKIE_NAME`). See
:doc:`/topics/i18n/index`.

.. setting:: LANGUAGES

LANGUAGES
---------

Default: A tuple of all available languages. This list is continually growing
and including a copy here would inevitably become rapidly out of date. You can
see the current list of translated languages by looking in
``django/conf/global_settings.py`` (or view the `online source`_).

.. _online source: https://github.com/django/django/blob/master/django/conf/global_settings.py

The list is a tuple of two-tuples in the format
(:term:`language code<language code>`, ``language name``) -- for example,
``('ja', 'Japanese')``.
This specifies which languages are available for language selection. See
:doc:`/topics/i18n/index`.

Generally, the default value should suffice. Only set this setting if you want
to restrict language selection to a subset of the Django-provided languages.

If you define a custom :setting:`LANGUAGES` setting, you can mark the
language names as translation strings using the
:func:`~django.utils.translation.ugettext_lazy` function.

Here's a sample settings file::

    from django.utils.translation import ugettext_lazy as _

    LANGUAGES = (
        ('de', _('German')),
        ('en', _('English')),
    )

.. setting:: LOCALE_PATHS

LOCALE_PATHS
------------

Default: ``()`` (Empty tuple)

A tuple of directories where Django looks for translation files.
See :ref:`how-django-discovers-translations`.

Example::

    LOCALE_PATHS = (
        '/home/www/project/common_files/locale',
        '/var/local/translations/locale'
    )

Django will look within each of these paths for the ``<locale_code>/LC_MESSAGES``
directories containing the actual translation files.

.. setting:: LOGGING

LOGGING
-------

Default: A logging configuration dictionary.

A data structure containing configuration information. The contents of
this data structure will be passed as the argument to the
configuration method described in :setting:`LOGGING_CONFIG`.

Among other things, the default logging configuration passes HTTP 500 server
errors to an email log handler when :setting:`DEBUG` is ``False``. See also
:ref:`configuring-logging`.

You can see the default logging configuration by looking in
``django/utils/log.py`` (or view the `online source`__).

__ https://github.com/django/django/blob/master/django/utils/log.py

.. setting:: LOGGING_CONFIG

LOGGING_CONFIG
--------------

Default: ``'django.utils.log.dictConfig'``

A path to a callable that will be used to configure logging in the
Django project. Points at a instance of Python's `dictConfig`_
configuration method by default.

If you set :setting:`LOGGING_CONFIG` to ``None``, the logging
configuration process will be skipped.

.. _dictConfig: http://docs.python.org/library/logging.config.html#configuration-dictionary-schema

.. setting:: MANAGERS

MANAGERS
--------

Default: ``()`` (Empty tuple)

A tuple in the same format as :setting:`ADMINS` that specifies who should get
broken link notifications when
:class:`~django.middleware.common.BrokenLinkEmailsMiddleware` is enabled.

.. setting:: MEDIA_ROOT

MEDIA_ROOT
----------

Default: ``''`` (Empty string)

Absolute filesystem path to the directory that will hold :doc:`user-uploaded
files </topics/files>`.

Example: ``"/var/www/example.com/media/"``

See also :setting:`MEDIA_URL`.

.. warning::

    :setting:`MEDIA_ROOT` and :setting:`STATIC_ROOT` must have different
    values. Before :setting:`STATIC_ROOT` was introduced, it was common to
    rely or fallback on :setting:`MEDIA_ROOT` to also serve static files;
    however, since this can have serious security implications, there is a
    validation check to prevent it.

.. setting:: MEDIA_URL

MEDIA_URL
---------

Default: ``''`` (Empty string)

URL that handles the media served from :setting:`MEDIA_ROOT`, used
for :doc:`managing stored files </topics/files>`. It must end in a slash if set
to a non-empty value. You will need to :ref:`configure these files to be served
<serving-uploaded-files-in-development>` in both development and production.

In order to use ``{{ MEDIA_URL }}`` in your templates, you must have
``'django.core.context_processors.media'`` in your
:setting:`TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS`. It's there by default, but be sure
to include it if you override that setting and want this behavior.

Example: ``"http://media.example.com/"``

.. warning::

    There are security risks if you are accepting uploaded content from
    untrusted users! See the security guide's topic on
    :ref:`user-uploaded-content-security` for mitigation details.

.. warning::

    :setting:`MEDIA_URL` and :setting:`STATIC_URL` must have different
    values. See :setting:`MEDIA_ROOT` for more details.

.. setting:: MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES

MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES
------------------

Default::

    ('django.middleware.common.CommonMiddleware',
     'django.contrib.sessions.middleware.SessionMiddleware',
     'django.middleware.csrf.CsrfViewMiddleware',
     'django.contrib.auth.middleware.AuthenticationMiddleware',
     'django.contrib.messages.middleware.MessageMiddleware',)

A tuple of middleware classes to use. See :doc:`/topics/http/middleware`.

.. setting:: MONTH_DAY_FORMAT

MONTH_DAY_FORMAT
----------------

Default: ``'F j'``

The default formatting to use for date fields on Django admin change-list
pages -- and, possibly, by other parts of the system -- in cases when only the
month and day are displayed.

For example, when a Django admin change-list page is being filtered by a date
drilldown, the header for a given day displays the day and month. Different
locales have different formats. For example, U.S. English would say
"January 1," whereas Spanish might say "1 Enero."

Note that if :setting:`USE_L10N` is set to ``True``, then the corresponding
locale-dictated format has higher precedence and will be applied.

See :tfilter:`allowed date format strings <date>`. See also
:setting:`DATE_FORMAT`, :setting:`DATETIME_FORMAT`,
:setting:`TIME_FORMAT` and :setting:`YEAR_MONTH_FORMAT`.

.. setting:: NUMBER_GROUPING

NUMBER_GROUPING
----------------

Default: ``0``

Number of digits grouped together on the integer part of a number.

Common use is to display a thousand separator. If this setting is ``0``, then
no grouping will be applied to the number. If this setting is greater than
``0``, then :setting:`THOUSAND_SEPARATOR` will be used as the separator between
those groups.

Note that if :setting:`USE_L10N` is set to ``True``, then the locale-dictated
format has higher precedence and will be applied instead.

See also :setting:`DECIMAL_SEPARATOR`, :setting:`THOUSAND_SEPARATOR` and
:setting:`USE_THOUSAND_SEPARATOR`.

.. setting:: PREPEND_WWW

PREPEND_WWW
-----------

Default: ``False``

Whether to prepend the "www." subdomain to URLs that don't have it. This is only
used if :class:`~django.middleware.common.CommonMiddleware` is installed
(see :doc:`/topics/http/middleware`). See also :setting:`APPEND_SLASH`.

.. setting:: ROOT_URLCONF

ROOT_URLCONF
------------

Default: Not defined

A string representing the full Python import path to your root URLconf. For example:
``"mydjangoapps.urls"``. Can be overridden on a per-request basis by
setting the attribute ``urlconf`` on the incoming ``HttpRequest``
object. See :ref:`how-django-processes-a-request` for details.

.. setting:: SECRET_KEY

SECRET_KEY
----------

Default: ``''`` (Empty string)

A secret key for a particular Django installation. This is used to provide
:doc:`cryptographic signing </topics/signing>`, and should be set to a unique,
unpredictable value.

:djadmin:`django-admin.py startproject <startproject>` automatically adds a
randomly-generated ``SECRET_KEY`` to each new project.

.. warning::

    **Keep this value secret.**

    Running Django with a known :setting:`SECRET_KEY` defeats many of Django's
    security protections, and can lead to privilege escalation and remote code
    execution vulnerabilities.

.. versionchanged:: 1.5

    Django will now refuse to start if :setting:`SECRET_KEY` is not set.

.. setting:: SECURE_PROXY_SSL_HEADER

SECURE_PROXY_SSL_HEADER
-----------------------

Default: ``None``

A tuple representing a HTTP header/value combination that signifies a request
is secure. This controls the behavior of the request object's ``is_secure()``
method.

This takes some explanation. By default, ``is_secure()`` is able to determine
whether a request is secure by looking at whether the requested URL uses
"https://". This is important for Django's CSRF protection, and may be used
by your own code or third-party apps.

If your Django app is behind a proxy, though, the proxy may be "swallowing" the
fact that a request is HTTPS, using a non-HTTPS connection between the proxy
and Django. In this case, ``is_secure()`` would always return ``False`` -- even
for requests that were made via HTTPS by the end user.

In this situation, you'll want to configure your proxy to set a custom HTTP
header that tells Django whether the request came in via HTTPS, and you'll want
to set ``SECURE_PROXY_SSL_HEADER`` so that Django knows what header to look
for.

You'll need to set a tuple with two elements -- the name of the header to look
for and the required value. For example::

    SECURE_PROXY_SSL_HEADER = ('HTTP_X_FORWARDED_PROTO', 'https')

Here, we're telling Django that we trust the ``X-Forwarded-Proto`` header
that comes from our proxy, and any time its value is ``'https'``, then the
request is guaranteed to be secure (i.e., it originally came in via HTTPS).
Obviously, you should *only* set this setting if you control your proxy or
have some other guarantee that it sets/strips this header appropriately.

Note that the header needs to be in the format as used by ``request.META`` --
all caps and likely starting with ``HTTP_``. (Remember, Django automatically
adds ``'HTTP_'`` to the start of x-header names before making the header
available in ``request.META``.)

.. warning::

    **You will probably open security holes in your site if you set this
    without knowing what you're doing. And if you fail to set it when you
    should. Seriously.**

    Make sure ALL of the following are true before setting this (assuming the
    values from the example above):

    * Your Django app is behind a proxy.
    * Your proxy strips the ``X-Forwarded-Proto`` header from all incoming
      requests. In other words, if end users include that header in their
      requests, the proxy will discard it.
    * Your proxy sets the ``X-Forwarded-Proto`` header and sends it to Django,
      but only for requests that originally come in via HTTPS.

    If any of those are not true, you should keep this setting set to ``None``
    and find another way of determining HTTPS, perhaps via custom middleware.

.. setting:: SEND_BROKEN_LINK_EMAILS

SEND_BROKEN_LINK_EMAILS
-----------------------

.. deprecated:: 1.6
    Since :class:`~django.middleware.common.BrokenLinkEmailsMiddleware`
    was split from :class:`~django.middleware.common.CommonMiddleware`,
    this setting no longer serves a purpose.

Default: ``False``

Whether to send an email to the :setting:`MANAGERS` each time somebody visits
a Django-powered page that is 404ed with a non-empty referer (i.e., a broken
link). This is only used if ``CommonMiddleware`` is installed (see
:doc:`/topics/http/middleware`). See also :setting:`IGNORABLE_404_URLS` and
:doc:`/howto/error-reporting`.

.. setting:: SERIALIZATION_MODULES

SERIALIZATION_MODULES
---------------------

Default: Not defined.

A dictionary of modules containing serializer definitions (provided as
strings), keyed by a string identifier for that serialization type. For
example, to define a YAML serializer, use::

    SERIALIZATION_MODULES = { 'yaml' : 'path.to.yaml_serializer' }

.. setting:: SERVER_EMAIL

SERVER_EMAIL
------------

Default: ``'root@localhost'``

The email address that error messages come from, such as those sent to
:setting:`ADMINS` and :setting:`MANAGERS`.

.. admonition:: Why are my emails sent from a different address?

    This address is used only for error messages. It is *not* the address that
    regular email messages sent with :meth:`~django.core.mail.send_mail()`
    come from; for that, see :setting:`DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL`.

.. setting:: SHORT_DATE_FORMAT

SHORT_DATE_FORMAT
-----------------

Default: ``m/d/Y`` (e.g. ``12/31/2003``)

An available formatting that can be used for displaying date fields on
templates. Note that if :setting:`USE_L10N` is set to ``True``, then the
corresponding locale-dictated format has higher precedence and will be applied.
See :tfilter:`allowed date format strings <date>`.

See also :setting:`DATE_FORMAT` and :setting:`SHORT_DATETIME_FORMAT`.

.. setting:: SHORT_DATETIME_FORMAT

SHORT_DATETIME_FORMAT
---------------------

Default: ``m/d/Y P`` (e.g. ``12/31/2003 4 p.m.``)

An available formatting that can be used for displaying datetime fields on
templates. Note that if :setting:`USE_L10N` is set to ``True``, then the
corresponding locale-dictated format has higher precedence and will be applied.
See :tfilter:`allowed date format strings <date>`.

See also :setting:`DATE_FORMAT` and :setting:`SHORT_DATE_FORMAT`.

.. setting:: SIGNING_BACKEND

SIGNING_BACKEND
---------------

Default: 'django.core.signing.TimestampSigner'

The backend used for signing cookies and other data.

See also the :doc:`/topics/signing` documentation.

.. setting:: TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS

TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS
---------------------------

Default::

    ("django.contrib.auth.context_processors.auth",
    "django.core.context_processors.debug",
    "django.core.context_processors.i18n",
    "django.core.context_processors.media",
    "django.core.context_processors.static",
    "django.core.context_processors.tz",
    "django.contrib.messages.context_processors.messages")

A tuple of callables that are used to populate the context in ``RequestContext``.
These callables take a request object as their argument and return a dictionary
of items to be merged into the context.

.. setting:: TEMPLATE_DEBUG

TEMPLATE_DEBUG
--------------

Default: ``False``

A boolean that turns on/off template debug mode. If this is ``True``, the fancy
error page will display a detailed report for any exception raised during
template rendering. This report contains the relevant snippet of the template,
with the appropriate line highlighted.

Note that Django only displays fancy error pages if :setting:`DEBUG` is ``True``, so
you'll want to set that to take advantage of this setting.

See also :setting:`DEBUG`.

.. setting:: TEMPLATE_DIRS

TEMPLATE_DIRS
-------------

Default: ``()`` (Empty tuple)

List of locations of the template source files searched by
:class:`django.template.loaders.filesystem.Loader`, in search order.

Note that these paths should use Unix-style forward slashes, even on Windows.

See :doc:`/topics/templates`.

.. setting:: TEMPLATE_LOADERS

TEMPLATE_LOADERS
----------------

Default::

     ('django.template.loaders.filesystem.Loader',
      'django.template.loaders.app_directories.Loader')

A tuple of template loader classes, specified as strings. Each ``Loader`` class
knows how to import templates from a particular source. Optionally, a tuple can be
used instead of a string. The first item in the tuple should be the ``Loader``’s
module, subsequent items are passed to the ``Loader`` during initialization. See
:doc:`/ref/templates/api`.

.. setting:: TEMPLATE_STRING_IF_INVALID

TEMPLATE_STRING_IF_INVALID
--------------------------

Default: ``''`` (Empty string)

Output, as a string, that the template system should use for invalid (e.g.
misspelled) variables. See :ref:`invalid-template-variables`..

.. setting:: TEST_RUNNER

TEST_RUNNER
-----------

Default: ``'django.test.runner.DiscoverRunner'``

The name of the class to use for starting the test suite. See
:ref:`other-testing-frameworks`.

.. versionchanged:: 1.6

    Previously the default ``TEST_RUNNER`` was
    ``django.test.simple.DjangoTestSuiteRunner``.

.. setting:: THOUSAND_SEPARATOR

THOUSAND_SEPARATOR
------------------

Default: ``,`` (Comma)

Default thousand separator used when formatting numbers. This setting is
used only when :setting:`USE_THOUSAND_SEPARATOR` is ``True`` and
:setting:`NUMBER_GROUPING` is greater than ``0``.

Note that if :setting:`USE_L10N` is set to ``True``, then the locale-dictated
format has higher precedence and will be applied instead.

See also :setting:`NUMBER_GROUPING`, :setting:`DECIMAL_SEPARATOR` and
:setting:`USE_THOUSAND_SEPARATOR`.

.. setting:: TIME_FORMAT

TIME_FORMAT
-----------

Default: ``'P'`` (e.g. ``4 p.m.``)

The default formatting to use for displaying time fields in any part of the
system. Note that if :setting:`USE_L10N` is set to ``True``, then the
locale-dictated format has higher precedence and will be applied instead. See
:tfilter:`allowed date format strings <date>`.

See also :setting:`DATE_FORMAT` and :setting:`DATETIME_FORMAT`.

.. setting:: TIME_INPUT_FORMATS

TIME_INPUT_FORMATS
------------------

Default::

    (
        '%H:%M:%S',     # '14:30:59'
        '%H:%M:%S.%f',  # '14:30:59.000200'
        '%H:%M',        # '14:30'
    )

A tuple of formats that will be accepted when inputting data on a time field.
Formats will be tried in order, using the first valid one. Note that these
format strings use Python's datetime_ module syntax, not the format strings
from the ``date`` Django template tag.

When :setting:`USE_L10N` is ``True``, the locale-dictated format has higher
precedence and will be applied instead.

See also :setting:`DATE_INPUT_FORMATS` and :setting:`DATETIME_INPUT_FORMATS`.

.. versionchanged:: 1.6

    Input format with microseconds has been added.

.. _datetime: http://docs.python.org/library/datetime.html#strftime-strptime-behavior

.. setting:: TIME_ZONE

TIME_ZONE
---------

Default: ``'America/Chicago'``

A string representing the time zone for this installation, or ``None``. See
the `list of time zones`_.

.. note::
    Since Django was first released with the :setting:`TIME_ZONE` set to
    ``'America/Chicago'``, the global setting (used if nothing is defined in
    your project's ``settings.py``) remains ``'America/Chicago'`` for backwards
    compatibility. New project templates default to ``'UTC'``.

Note that this isn't necessarily the time zone of the server. For example, one
server may serve multiple Django-powered sites, each with a separate time zone
setting.

When :setting:`USE_TZ` is ``False``, this is the time zone in which Django
will store all datetimes. When :setting:`USE_TZ` is ``True``, this is the
default time zone that Django will use to display datetimes in templates and
to interpret datetimes entered in forms.

Django sets the ``os.environ['TZ']`` variable to the time zone you specify in
the :setting:`TIME_ZONE` setting. Thus, all your views and models will
automatically operate in this time zone. However, Django won't set the ``TZ``
environment variable under the following conditions:

* If you're using the manual configuration option as described in
  :ref:`manually configuring settings
  <settings-without-django-settings-module>`, or

* If you specify ``TIME_ZONE = None``. This will cause Django to fall back to
  using the system timezone. However, this is discouraged when :setting:`USE_TZ
  = True <USE_TZ>`, because it makes conversions between local time and UTC
  less reliable.

If Django doesn't set the ``TZ`` environment variable, it's up to you
to ensure your processes are running in the correct environment.

.. note::
    Django cannot reliably use alternate time zones in a Windows environment.
    If you're running Django on Windows, :setting:`TIME_ZONE` must be set to
    match the system time zone.

.. _list of time zones: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones

.. _pytz: http://pytz.sourceforge.net/

.. setting:: TRANSACTIONS_MANAGED

TRANSACTIONS_MANAGED
--------------------

.. deprecated:: 1.6

    This setting was deprecated because its name is very misleading. Use the
    :setting:`AUTOCOMMIT <DATABASE-AUTOCOMMIT>` key in :setting:`DATABASES`
    entries instead.

Default: ``False``

Set this to ``True`` if you want to :ref:`disable Django's transaction
management <deactivate-transaction-management>` and implement your own.

.. setting:: USE_ETAGS

USE_ETAGS
---------

Default: ``False``

A boolean that specifies whether to output the "Etag" header. This saves
bandwidth but slows down performance. This is used by the ``CommonMiddleware``
(see :doc:`/topics/http/middleware`) and in the``Cache Framework``
(see :doc:`/topics/cache`).

.. setting:: USE_I18N

USE_I18N
--------

Default: ``True``

A boolean that specifies whether Django's translation system should be enabled.
This provides an easy way to turn it off, for performance. If this is set to
``False``, Django will make some optimizations so as not to load the
translation machinery.

See also :setting:`LANGUAGE_CODE`, :setting:`USE_L10N` and :setting:`USE_TZ`.

.. setting:: USE_L10N

USE_L10N
--------

Default: ``False``

A boolean that specifies if localized formatting of data will be enabled by
default or not. If this is set to ``True``, e.g. Django will display numbers and
dates using the format of the current locale.

See also :setting:`LANGUAGE_CODE`, :setting:`USE_I18N` and :setting:`USE_TZ`.

.. note::

    The default :file:`settings.py` file created by :djadmin:`django-admin.py
    startproject <startproject>` includes ``USE_L10N = True`` for convenience.

.. setting:: USE_THOUSAND_SEPARATOR

USE_THOUSAND_SEPARATOR
----------------------

Default: ``False``

A boolean that specifies whether to display numbers using a thousand separator.
When :setting:`USE_L10N` is set to ``True`` and if this is also set to
``True``, Django will use the values of :setting:`THOUSAND_SEPARATOR` and
:setting:`NUMBER_GROUPING` to format numbers.

See also :setting:`DECIMAL_SEPARATOR`, :setting:`NUMBER_GROUPING` and
:setting:`THOUSAND_SEPARATOR`.

.. setting:: USE_TZ

USE_TZ
------

Default: ``False``

A boolean that specifies if datetimes will be timezone-aware by default or not.
If this is set to ``True``, Django will use timezone-aware datetimes internally.
Otherwise, Django will use naive datetimes in local time.

See also :setting:`TIME_ZONE`, :setting:`USE_I18N` and :setting:`USE_L10N`.

.. note::

    The default :file:`settings.py` file created by
    :djadmin:`django-admin.py startproject <startproject>` includes
    ``USE_TZ = True`` for convenience.

.. setting:: USE_X_FORWARDED_HOST

USE_X_FORWARDED_HOST
--------------------

Default: ``False``

A boolean that specifies whether to use the X-Forwarded-Host header in
preference to the Host header. This should only be enabled if a proxy
which sets this header is in use.

.. setting:: WSGI_APPLICATION

WSGI_APPLICATION
----------------

Default: ``None``

The full Python path of the WSGI application object that Django's built-in
servers (e.g. :djadmin:`runserver`) will use. The :djadmin:`django-admin.py
startproject <startproject>` management command will create a simple
``wsgi.py`` file with an ``application`` callable in it, and point this setting
to that ``application``.

If not set, the return value of ``django.core.wsgi.get_wsgi_application()``
will be used. In this case, the behavior of :djadmin:`runserver` will be
identical to previous Django versions.

.. setting:: YEAR_MONTH_FORMAT

YEAR_MONTH_FORMAT
-----------------

Default: ``'F Y'``

The default formatting to use for date fields on Django admin change-list
pages -- and, possibly, by other parts of the system -- in cases when only the
year and month are displayed.

For example, when a Django admin change-list page is being filtered by a date
drilldown, the header for a given month displays the month and the year.
Different locales have different formats. For example, U.S. English would say
"January 2006," whereas another locale might say "2006/January."

Note that if :setting:`USE_L10N` is set to ``True``, then the corresponding
locale-dictated format has higher precedence and will be applied.

See :tfilter:`allowed date format strings <date>`. See also
:setting:`DATE_FORMAT`, :setting:`DATETIME_FORMAT`, :setting:`TIME_FORMAT`
and :setting:`MONTH_DAY_FORMAT`.

.. setting:: X_FRAME_OPTIONS

X_FRAME_OPTIONS
---------------

Default: ``'SAMEORIGIN'``

The default value for the X-Frame-Options header used by
:class:`~django.middleware.clickjacking.XFrameOptionsMiddleware`. See the
:doc:`clickjacking protection </ref/clickjacking/>` documentation.


Admindocs
=========

Settings for :mod:`django.contrib.admindocs`.

.. setting:: ADMIN_FOR

ADMIN_FOR
---------

Default: ``()`` (Empty tuple)

Used for admin-site settings modules, this should be a tuple of settings
modules (in the format ``'foo.bar.baz'``) for which this site is an admin.

The admin site uses this in its automatically-introspected documentation of
models, views and template tags.


Auth
====

Settings for :mod:`django.contrib.auth`.

.. setting:: AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS

AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS
-----------------------

Default: ``('django.contrib.auth.backends.ModelBackend',)``

A tuple of authentication backend classes (as strings) to use when attempting to
authenticate a user. See the :ref:`authentication backends documentation
<authentication-backends>` for details.

.. setting:: AUTH_PROFILE_MODULE

AUTH_PROFILE_MODULE
-------------------

.. deprecated:: 1.5
    With the introduction of :ref:`custom User models <auth-custom-user>`,
    the use of :setting:`AUTH_PROFILE_MODULE` to define a single profile
    model is no longer supported. See the
    :doc:`Django 1.5 release notes</releases/1.5>` for more information.

Default: Not defined

The site-specific user profile model used by this site. See
:ref:`User profiles <auth-profiles>`.

.. setting:: AUTH_USER_MODEL

AUTH_USER_MODEL
---------------

Default: 'auth.User'

The model to use to represent a User. See :ref:`auth-custom-user`.

.. setting:: LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL

LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL
------------------

Default: ``'/accounts/profile/'``

The URL where requests are redirected after login when the
``contrib.auth.login`` view gets no ``next`` parameter.

This is used by the :func:`~django.contrib.auth.decorators.login_required`
decorator, for example.

.. versionchanged:: 1.5

    This setting now also accepts view function names and
    :ref:`named URL patterns <naming-url-patterns>` which can be used to reduce
    configuration duplication since you no longer have to define the URL in two
    places (``settings`` and URLconf).
    For backward compatibility reasons the default remains unchanged.

.. setting:: LOGIN_URL

LOGIN_URL
---------

Default: ``'/accounts/login/'``

The URL where requests are redirected for login, especially when using the
:func:`~django.contrib.auth.decorators.login_required` decorator.

.. versionchanged:: 1.5

    This setting now also accepts view function names and
    :ref:`named URL patterns <naming-url-patterns>` which can be used to reduce
    configuration duplication since you no longer have to define the URL in two
    places (``settings`` and URLconf).
    For backward compatibility reasons the default remains unchanged.

.. setting:: LOGOUT_URL

LOGOUT_URL
----------

Default: ``'/accounts/logout/'``

LOGIN_URL counterpart.

.. setting:: PASSWORD_RESET_TIMEOUT_DAYS

PASSWORD_RESET_TIMEOUT_DAYS
---------------------------

Default: ``3``

The number of days a password reset link is valid for. Used by the
:mod:`django.contrib.auth` password reset mechanism.

.. setting:: PASSWORD_HASHERS

PASSWORD_HASHERS
----------------

See :ref:`auth_password_storage`.

Default::

    ('django.contrib.auth.hashers.PBKDF2PasswordHasher',
     'django.contrib.auth.hashers.PBKDF2SHA1PasswordHasher',
     'django.contrib.auth.hashers.BCryptPasswordHasher',
     'django.contrib.auth.hashers.SHA1PasswordHasher',
     'django.contrib.auth.hashers.MD5PasswordHasher',
     'django.contrib.auth.hashers.UnsaltedMD5PasswordHasher',
     'django.contrib.auth.hashers.CryptPasswordHasher',)


.. _settings-comments:

Comments
========

Settings for :mod:`django.contrib.comments`.

.. setting:: COMMENTS_HIDE_REMOVED

COMMENTS_HIDE_REMOVED
---------------------

If ``True`` (default), removed comments will be excluded from comment
lists/counts (as taken from template tags). Otherwise, the template author is
responsible for some sort of a "this comment has been removed by the site staff"
message.

.. setting:: COMMENT_MAX_LENGTH

COMMENT_MAX_LENGTH
------------------

The maximum length of the comment field, in characters. Comments longer than
this will be rejected. Defaults to 3000.

.. setting:: COMMENTS_APP

COMMENTS_APP
------------

An app which provides :doc:`customization of the comments framework
</ref/contrib/comments/custom>`.  Use the same dotted-string notation
as in :setting:`INSTALLED_APPS`.  Your custom :setting:`COMMENTS_APP`
must also be listed in :setting:`INSTALLED_APPS`.

.. setting:: PROFANITIES_LIST

PROFANITIES_LIST
----------------

Default: ``()`` (Empty tuple)

A tuple of profanities, as strings, that will be forbidden in comments when
``COMMENTS_ALLOW_PROFANITIES`` is ``False``.


.. _settings-messages:

Messages
========

Settings for :mod:`django.contrib.messages`.

.. setting:: MESSAGE_LEVEL

MESSAGE_LEVEL
-------------

Default: ``messages.INFO``

Sets the minimum message level that will be recorded by the messages
framework. See :ref:`message levels <message-level>` for more details.

.. admonition:: Important

   If you override ``MESSAGE_LEVEL`` in your settings file and rely on any of
   the built-in constants, you must import the constants module directly to
   avoid the potential for circular imports, e.g.::

       from django.contrib.messages import constants as message_constants
       MESSAGE_LEVEL = message_constants.DEBUG

   If desired, you may specify the numeric values for the constants directly
   according to the values in the above :ref:`constants table
   <message-level-constants>`.

.. setting:: MESSAGE_STORAGE

MESSAGE_STORAGE
---------------

Default: ``'django.contrib.messages.storage.fallback.FallbackStorage'``

Controls where Django stores message data. Valid values are:

* ``'django.contrib.messages.storage.fallback.FallbackStorage'``
* ``'django.contrib.messages.storage.session.SessionStorage'``
* ``'django.contrib.messages.storage.cookie.CookieStorage'``

See :ref:`message storage backends <message-storage-backends>` for more details.

The backends that use cookies --
:class:`~django.contrib.messages.storage.cookie.CookieStorage` and
:class:`~django.contrib.messages.storage.fallback.FallbackStorage` --
use the value of :setting:`SESSION_COOKIE_DOMAIN` when setting their cookies.

.. setting:: MESSAGE_TAGS

MESSAGE_TAGS
------------

Default::

    {messages.DEBUG: 'debug',
    messages.INFO: 'info',
    messages.SUCCESS: 'success',
    messages.WARNING: 'warning',
    messages.ERROR: 'error',}

This sets the mapping of message level to message tag, which is typically
rendered as a CSS class in HTML. If you specify a value, it will extend
the default. This means you only have to specify those values which you need
to override. See :ref:`message-displaying` above for more details.

.. admonition:: Important

   If you override ``MESSAGE_TAGS`` in your settings file and rely on any of
   the built-in constants, you must import the ``constants`` module directly to
   avoid the potential for circular imports, e.g.::

       from django.contrib.messages import constants as message_constants
       MESSAGE_TAGS = {message_constants.INFO: ''}

   If desired, you may specify the numeric values for the constants directly
   according to the values in the above :ref:`constants table
   <message-level-constants>`.

.. _settings-sessions:

Sessions
========

Settings for :mod:`django.contrib.sessions`.

.. setting:: SESSION_CACHE_ALIAS

SESSION_CACHE_ALIAS
-------------------

Default: ``default``

If you're using :ref:`cache-based session storage <cached-sessions-backend>`,
this selects the cache to use.

.. setting:: SESSION_COOKIE_AGE

SESSION_COOKIE_AGE
------------------

Default: ``1209600`` (2 weeks, in seconds)

The age of session cookies, in seconds.

.. setting:: SESSION_COOKIE_DOMAIN

SESSION_COOKIE_DOMAIN
---------------------

Default: ``None``

The domain to use for session cookies. Set this to a string such as
``".example.com"`` (note the leading dot!) for cross-domain cookies, or use
``None`` for a standard domain cookie.

Be cautious when updating this setting on a production site. If you update
this setting to enable cross-domain cookies on a site that previously used
standard domain cookies, existing user cookies will be set to the old
domain. This may result in them being unable to log in as long as these cookies
persist.

.. setting:: SESSION_COOKIE_HTTPONLY

SESSION_COOKIE_HTTPONLY
-----------------------

Default: ``True``

Whether to use ``HTTPOnly`` flag on the session cookie. If this is set to
``True``, client-side JavaScript will not to be able to access the
session cookie.

HTTPOnly_ is a flag included in a Set-Cookie HTTP response header. It
is not part of the :rfc:`2109` standard for cookies, and it isn't honored
consistently by all browsers. However, when it is honored, it can be a
useful way to mitigate the risk of client side script accessing the
protected cookie data.

.. _HTTPOnly: https://www.owasp.org/index.php/HTTPOnly

.. setting:: SESSION_COOKIE_NAME

SESSION_COOKIE_NAME
-------------------

Default: ``'sessionid'``

The name of the cookie to use for sessions. This can be whatever you want (but
should be different from :setting:`LANGUAGE_COOKIE_NAME`).

.. setting:: SESSION_COOKIE_PATH

SESSION_COOKIE_PATH
-------------------

Default: ``'/'``

The path set on the session cookie. This should either match the URL path of your
Django installation or be parent of that path.

This is useful if you have multiple Django instances running under the same
hostname. They can use different cookie paths, and each instance will only see
its own session cookie.

.. setting:: SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE

SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE
---------------------

Default: ``False``

Whether to use a secure cookie for the session cookie. If this is set to
``True``, the cookie will be marked as "secure," which means browsers may
ensure that the cookie is only sent under an HTTPS connection.

.. setting:: SESSION_ENGINE

SESSION_ENGINE
--------------

Default: ``django.contrib.sessions.backends.db``

Controls where Django stores session data. Included engines are:

* ``'django.contrib.sessions.backends.db'``
* ``'django.contrib.sessions.backends.file'``
* ``'django.contrib.sessions.backends.cache'``
* ``'django.contrib.sessions.backends.cached_db'``
* ``'django.contrib.sessions.backends.signed_cookies'``

See :ref:`configuring-sessions` for more details.

.. setting:: SESSION_EXPIRE_AT_BROWSER_CLOSE

SESSION_EXPIRE_AT_BROWSER_CLOSE
-------------------------------

Default: ``False``

Whether to expire the session when the user closes his or her browser. See
:ref:`browser-length-vs-persistent-sessions`.

.. setting:: SESSION_FILE_PATH

SESSION_FILE_PATH
-----------------

Default: ``None``

If you're using file-based session storage, this sets the directory in
which Django will store session data. When the default value (``None``) is
used, Django will use the standard temporary directory for the system.


.. setting:: SESSION_SAVE_EVERY_REQUEST

SESSION_SAVE_EVERY_REQUEST
--------------------------

Default: ``False``

Whether to save the session data on every request. If this is ``False``
(default), then the session data will only be saved if it has been modified --
that is, if any of its dictionary values have been assigned or deleted.

.. setting:: SESSION_SERIALIZER

SESSION_SERIALIZER
------------------

.. versionadded:: 1.5.3

Default: ``'django.contrib.sessions.serializers.JSONSerializer'``

.. versionchanged:: 1.6

    The default switched from
    :class:`~django.contrib.sessions.serializers.PickleSerializer` to
    :class:`~django.contrib.sessions.serializers.JSONSerializer` in Django 1.6.

Full import path of a serializer class to use for serializing session data.
Included serializers are:

* ``'django.contrib.sessions.serializers.PickleSerializer'``
* ``'django.contrib.sessions.serializers.JSONSerializer'``

See :ref:`session_serialization` for details, including a warning regarding
possible remote code execution when using
:class:`~django.contrib.sessions.serializers.PickleSerializer`.

Sites
=====

Settings for :mod:`django.contrib.sites`.

.. setting:: SITE_ID

SITE_ID
-------

Default: Not defined

The ID, as an integer, of the current site in the ``django_site`` database
table. This is used so that application data can hook into specific sites
and a single database can manage content for multiple sites.


.. _settings-staticfiles:

Static files
============

Settings for :mod:`django.contrib.staticfiles`.

.. setting:: STATIC_ROOT

STATIC_ROOT
-----------

Default: ``None``

.. versionchanged:: 1.6.2

    The default changed from ``''`` (empty string) to ``None``.

The absolute path to the directory where :djadmin:`collectstatic` will collect
static files for deployment.

Example: ``"/var/www/example.com/static/"``

If the :doc:`staticfiles</ref/contrib/staticfiles>` contrib app is enabled
(default) the :djadmin:`collectstatic` management command will collect static
files into this directory. See the howto on :doc:`managing static
files</howto/static-files/index>` for more details about usage.

.. warning::

    This should be an (initially empty) destination directory for collecting
    your static files from their permanent locations into one directory for
    ease of deployment; it is **not** a place to store your static files
    permanently. You should do that in directories that will be found by
    :doc:`staticfiles</ref/contrib/staticfiles>`’s
    :setting:`finders<STATICFILES_FINDERS>`, which by default, are
    ``'static/'`` app sub-directories and any directories you include in
    :setting:`STATICFILES_DIRS`).

.. setting:: STATIC_URL

STATIC_URL
----------

Default: ``None``

URL to use when referring to static files located in :setting:`STATIC_ROOT`.

Example: ``"/static/"`` or ``"http://static.example.com/"``

If not ``None``, this will be used as the base path for
:ref:`asset definitions<form-asset-paths>` (the ``Media`` class) and the
:doc:`staticfiles app</ref/contrib/staticfiles>`.

It must end in a slash if set to a non-empty value.

You may need to :ref:`configure these files to be served in development
<serving-static-files-in-development>` and will definitely need to do so
:doc:`in production </howto/static-files/deployment>`.

.. setting:: STATICFILES_DIRS

STATICFILES_DIRS
----------------

Default: ``[]``

This setting defines the additional locations the staticfiles app will traverse
if the ``FileSystemFinder`` finder is enabled, e.g. if you use the
:djadmin:`collectstatic` or :djadmin:`findstatic` management command or use the
static file serving view.

This should be set to a list or tuple of strings that contain full paths to
your additional files directory(ies) e.g.::

    STATICFILES_DIRS = (
        "/home/special.polls.com/polls/static",
        "/home/polls.com/polls/static",
        "/opt/webfiles/common",
    )

Note that these paths should use Unix-style forward slashes, even on Windows
(e.g. ``"C:/Users/user/mysite/extra_static_content"``).

Prefixes (optional)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In case you want to refer to files in one of the locations with an additional
namespace, you can **optionally** provide a prefix as ``(prefix, path)``
tuples, e.g.::

    STATICFILES_DIRS = (
        # ...
        ("downloads", "/opt/webfiles/stats"),
    )

For example, assuming you have :setting:`STATIC_URL` set to ``'/static/'``, the
:djadmin:`collectstatic` management command would collect the "stats" files
in a ``'downloads'`` subdirectory of :setting:`STATIC_ROOT`.

This would allow you to refer to the local file
``'/opt/webfiles/stats/polls_20101022.tar.gz'`` with
``'/static/downloads/polls_20101022.tar.gz'`` in your templates, e.g.:

.. code-block:: html+django

    <a href="{% static "downloads/polls_20101022.tar.gz" %}">

.. setting:: STATICFILES_STORAGE

STATICFILES_STORAGE
-------------------

Default: ``'django.contrib.staticfiles.storage.StaticFilesStorage'``

The file storage engine to use when collecting static files with the
:djadmin:`collectstatic` management command.

A ready-to-use instance of the storage backend defined in this setting
can be found at ``django.contrib.staticfiles.storage.staticfiles_storage``.

For an example, see :ref:`staticfiles-from-cdn`.

.. setting:: STATICFILES_FINDERS

STATICFILES_FINDERS
-------------------

Default::

    ("django.contrib.staticfiles.finders.FileSystemFinder",
     "django.contrib.staticfiles.finders.AppDirectoriesFinder")

The list of finder backends that know how to find static files in
various locations.

The default will find files stored in the :setting:`STATICFILES_DIRS` setting
(using ``django.contrib.staticfiles.finders.FileSystemFinder``) and in a
``static`` subdirectory of each app (using
``django.contrib.staticfiles.finders.AppDirectoriesFinder``). If multiple
files with the same name are present, the first file that is found will be
used.

One finder is disabled by default:
``django.contrib.staticfiles.finders.DefaultStorageFinder``. If added to
your :setting:`STATICFILES_FINDERS` setting, it will look for static files in
the default file storage as defined by the :setting:`DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE`
setting.

.. note::

    When using the ``AppDirectoriesFinder`` finder, make sure your apps
    can be found by staticfiles. Simply add the app to the
    :setting:`INSTALLED_APPS` setting of your site.

Static file finders are currently considered a private interface, and this
interface is thus undocumented.
