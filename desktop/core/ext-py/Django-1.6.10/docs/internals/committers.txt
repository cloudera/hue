Django originally started at World Online, the Web department of the `Lawrence
Journal-World`_ of Lawrence, Kansas, USA.

`Adrian Holovaty`_
    Adrian is a Web developer with a background in journalism. He's known in
    journalism circles as one of the pioneers of "journalism via computer
    programming", and in technical circles as "the guy who invented Django."

    He was lead developer at World Online for 2.5 years, during which time
    Django was developed and implemented on World Online's sites. He was the
    leader and founder of EveryBlock_, a "news feed for your block." He now
    develops for Soundslice_.

    Adrian lives in Chicago, USA.

`Simon Willison`_
    Simon is a well-respected Web developer from England. He had a one-year
    internship at World Online, during which time he and Adrian developed Django
    from scratch. The most enthusiastic Brit you'll ever meet, he's passionate
    about best practices in Web development and maintains a well-read
    `web-development blog`_.

    Simon lives in Brighton, England.

`Jacob Kaplan-Moss`_
    Jacob is Director of Platform Security at Heroku_. He worked at World
    Online for four years, where he helped open source Django and found
    the Django Software Foundation. Jacob lives on a hobby farm outside of
    Lawrence where he spends his weekends playing with dirt and power tools.

`Wilson Miner`_
    Wilson's design-fu is what makes Django look so nice. He designed the
    Web site you're looking at right now, as well as Django's acclaimed admin
    interface. Wilson was the designer for EveryBlock and Rdio_. He now
    designs for Facebook.

Adrian and Jacob are the Co-`Benevolent Dictators for Life`_ of Django. When
"rough consensus and working code" fails, they're the ones who make the tough
decisions.

Core developers
---------------

These are the folks who have a long history of contributions, a solid track
record of being helpful on the mailing lists, and a proven desire to dedicate
serious time to Django. In return, they've been granted the coveted commit bit,
and have free rein to hack on all parts of Django.

Malcolm Tredinnick
    Malcolm originally wanted to be a mathematician, somehow ended up a software
    developer. He's contributed to many Open Source projects, has served on the
    board of the GNOME foundation, and will kick your ass at chess.

`Luke Plant`_
    At University Luke studied physics and Materials Science and also
    met `Michael Meeks`_ who introduced him to Linux and Open Source,
    re-igniting an interest in programming.  Since then he has
    contributed to a number of Open Source projects and worked
    professionally as a developer.

    Luke has contributed many excellent improvements to Django,

    his PhD. His first job was with a startup in the defense industry developing
    simulation frameworks. Over time, mostly through work with Django, he's
    become more involved in Web development.

    Russell has helped with several major aspects of Django, including a
    couple major internal refactorings, creation of the test system, and more.

    better pay. He lives in Lawrence, Kansas and previously worked at
    World Online; currently, he's part of the Web development team at
    Mozilla.

    communications software (industry) and crossword puzzle construction
    (freelance).  The last of these brought her to Django, in late 2006, when
    she set out to put a Web front-end on her crossword puzzle database.
    That done, she stuck around in the community answering questions, debugging
    problems, etc. -- because coding puzzles are as much fun as word puzzles.

Ramiro Morales
    Ramiro has been reading Django source code and submitting patches since
    mid-2006 after researching for a Python Web tool with matching awesomeness
    and being pointed to it by an old ninja.

    A software developer in the electronic transactions industry, he is a
    living proof of the fact that anyone with enough enthusiasm can contribute
    to Django, learning a lot and having fun in the process.

    Ramiro lives in CÃ³rdoba, Argentina.

`Gabriel Hurley`_
    Gabriel has been working with Django since 2008, shortly after the 1.0
    release. Convinced by his business partner that Python and Django were the
    right direction for the company, he couldn't have been more happy with the

`Paul McMillan`_
    Paul found Django in 2008 while looking for a more
    structured approach to web programming. He stuck around after
    figuring out that the developers of Django had already invented
    many of the wheels he needed. His passion for breaking (and then
    fixing) things led to his current role working to maintain and
    improve the security of Django.

    Paul works in Berkeley, California as a `web developer`_ and `security
    consultant`_.

`Aymeric Augustin`_
    Aymeric is an engineer with a background in mathematics and computer
    science. He chose Django because he believes that software should be simple,
    explicit and tested. His perfectionist tendencies quickly led him to triage
    tickets and contribute patches.

    a continuous integration server, and likes proving that Django is a good
    choice for enterprise software.

Jeremy Dunck
    Jeremy was rescued from corporate IT drudgery by Free Software and, in part,
    Django.  Many of Jeremy's interests center around access to information.

    Jeremy was the lead developer of Pegasus News, one of the first uses of
    Django outside World Online, and has since joined Votizen, a startup intent
    on reducing the influence of money in politics.

    He serves as DSF Secretary, organizes and helps organize sprints, cares
    about the health and equity of the Django community.  He has gone an
    embarrassingly long time without a working blog.

`Bryan Veloso`_
    Bryan found Django 0.96 through a fellow designer who was evangelizing
    its use. It was his first foray outside of the land that was PHP-based
    templating. Although he has only ever used Django for personal projects,
    it is the very reason he considers himself a designer/developer
    hybrid and is working to further design within the Django community.

    Bryan works as a designer at GitHub by day, and masquerades as a `vlogger`_
    and `shoutcaster`_ in the after-hours. Bryan lives in Los Angeles, CA, USA.

    Preston is a recovering neuroscientist who originally discovered Django as
    part of a sweeping move to Python from a grab bag of half a dozen
    languages. He was drawn to Django's balance of practical batteries included
    philosophy, care and thought in code design, and strong open source
    community. In addition to his current job in private progressive education,
    Preston contributes some developer time to local non-profits.
