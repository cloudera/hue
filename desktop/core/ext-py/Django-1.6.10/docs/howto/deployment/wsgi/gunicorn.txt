How to use Django with Gunicorn
===============================

.. highlight:: bash

Gunicorn_ ('Green Unicorn') is a pure-Python WSGI server for UNIX. It has no
dependencies and is easy to install and use.

Installing Gunicorn
===================

Installing gunicorn is as easy as ``sudo pip install gunicorn``. For more
details, see the `gunicorn documentation`_.

.. _gunicorn documentation: http://docs.gunicorn.org/en/latest/install.html

Running Django in Gunicorn as a generic WSGI application
========================================================

When Gunicorn is installed, a ``gunicorn`` command is available which starts
the Gunicorn server process. At its simplest, gunicorn just needs to be called
with a the location of a WSGI application object.::

    gunicorn [OPTIONS] APP_MODULE

Where ``APP_MODULE`` is of the pattern ``MODULE_NAME:VARIABLE_NAME``. The
module name should be a full dotted path. The variable name refers to a WSGI
callable that should be found in the specified module.

So for a typical Django project, invoking gunicorn would look like::

    gunicorn myproject.wsgi:application

(This requires that your project be on the Python path; the simplest way to
ensure that is to run this command from the same directory as your
``manage.py`` file.)

See Gunicorn's `deployment documentation`_ for additional tips.
