I am happy to announce Guppy-PE 0.1.10

Guppy-PE is a library and programming environment for Python,
currently providing in particular the Heapy subsystem, which supports
object and heap memory sizing, profiling and debugging. It also
includes a prototypical specification language, the Guppy
Specification Language (GSL), which can be used to formally specify
aspects of Python programs and generate tests and documentation from a
common source.

The main news in this release:

o Support for Python 2.7
  However, there are still some problems with the tests
  that I haven't been able to sort out.

o Some minor bug fixes
