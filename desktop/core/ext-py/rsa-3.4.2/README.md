[Python-RSA](https://stuvel.eu/rsa) is a pure-Python RSA implementation. It supports
encryption and decryption, signing and verifying signatures, and key
generation according to PKCS#1 version 1.5. It can be used as a Python
library as well as on the commandline. The code was mostly written by
Sybren A.  St√ºvel.

Documentation can be found at the [Python-RSA homepage](https://stuvel.eu/rsa).

Download and install using:

    pip install rsa

or download it from the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/rsa).

Plans for the future
--------------------

Version 3.4 is the last version in the 3.x range. Version 4.0 will drop the following modules,
as they are insecure:

- `rsa._version133`
- `rsa._version200`
- `rsa.bigfile`
- `rsa.varblock`

Those modules are marked as deprecated in version 3.4.

Furthermore, in 4.0 the I/O functions will be streamlined to always work with bytes on all
supported versions of Python.
