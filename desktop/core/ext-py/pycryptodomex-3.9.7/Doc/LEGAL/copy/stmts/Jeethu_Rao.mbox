Hi Jeethu,

I am the new maintainer of the Python Cryptography Toolkit, and I am 
working on a new release at http://www.pycrypto.org/.

People often ask me what license PyCrypto is covered by, if it's 
GPL-compatible, etc.  Right now, I'm not really sure what to tell them.  
The text in the current LICENSE file (quoted below) is not entirely clear 
on the point of whether distributing modified versions is allowed.  (It 
says "distribute and use", but not "modify".)

 ===================================================================
 Distribute and use freely; there are no restrictions on further
 dissemination and usage except those imposed by the laws of your
 country of residence.  This software is provided "as is" without
 warranty of fitness for use or suitability for any purpose, express
 or implied. Use at your own risk or not at all.
 ===================================================================

 Incorporating the code into commercial products is permitted; you do
 not have to make source available or contribute your changes back
 (though that would be nice).

 --amk                                                    (www.amk.ca)

For the next PyCrypto release, I would like to take steps to move toward a 
clearer licensing regime.  I am asking as many copyright holders as I can 
find if I can release PyCrypto under something clearer and more standard.  
Below, I have quoted a public domain dedication that was recommended in 
_Intellectual Property and Open Source: A Practical Guide to Protecting 
Code_, by Van Lindberg.  I have already contacted A. M. Kuchling, Robey 
Pointer, and Wim Lewis, and they have all approved the following text for 
their contributions.

I understand that you have made contributions to PyCrypto.  May I, on your 
behalf, dedicate to the public domain all your contributions to PyCrypto, 
with the following notice?

 =======================================================================
 The contents of this file are dedicated to the public domain.  To the
 extent that dedication to the public domain is not available, everyone

Hi Dwayne,My contribution to pycrypto are very very minimal (The sha256
module, IIRC).
I'd be fine with the public domain license for PyCrypto.
