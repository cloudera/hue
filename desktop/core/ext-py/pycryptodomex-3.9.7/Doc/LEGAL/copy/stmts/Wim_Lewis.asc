Certainly! I think the only code of mine in PyCrypto is the CAST-5 / CAST-128
implementation, which already has a public-domain notice at the top of
the file. But I am happy to have that, any any other code of mine that
might have wandered in there under an unclear open sourcish license,
distributed under the public-domain dedication you quote.

Wim.
