Version 2.2.3
=============

:Released: 2019-01-21
:Maintainer: Ben Finney <ben+python@benfinney.id.au>

Bug Fixes:

* Use custom fake file type for testing `fileno` behaviour.

  This works around an incompatibility in Python 2.7 `file` type that
  caused test cases to fail.

Changes:

* Promote the warning for `runner` module to a `DeprecationWarning`.
  This has been an unofficial example module from the beginning, and
  it will be removed in a future version.


Version 2.2.2
=============

:Released: 2019-01-19
:Maintainer: Ben Finney <ben+python@benfinney.id.au>

Bug Fixes:

* Remove from the build system specification a white space character
  not permitted in TOML format.

Additions:

* Implement test suite automation in virtualenvs, using Tox.


Version 2.2.1
=============

:Released: 2019-01-18
:Maintainer: Ben Finney <ben+python@benfinney.id.au>

Additions:

* Add a :PEP:`518` conformant build system specification (the
  ``pyproject.toml`` file).


Version 2.2.0
=============

:Released: 2018-08-15
:Maintainer: Ben Finney <ben+python@benfinney.id.au>

Bug Fixes:

* Correct the description of the return value for
  `daemon.is_detach_process_context_required`.

  Closes: Pagure #6.

* Set a sensible default for `Distribution.script_name`.

  This works around a bug in Setuptools which calls commands before
  the `Distribution` is initialised.

  Closes: Pagure #2.

Changes:

* The test suite now relies on the test discovery feature in
  ‘unittest’. This feature is in Python version 2.7 and later.

* Improve performance of `daemon.close_all_open_files`.

  Thanks to Darek Działak for the implementation.

  Closes: Pagure #10.


Version 2.1.2
=============

:Released: 2016-10-26
:Maintainer: Ben Finney <ben+python@benfinney.id.au>

Additions:

* Add a README document for the code base.

Changes:

* Migrate code project hosting to Pagure.
  Record the change of homepage URL in PyPI metadata.
* Raise a warning that the ‘runner’ module is pending deprecation.
  This has been an unofficial example module from the beginning, and
  it will be removed in a future version.

Bug Fixes:

* Ensure custom types are part of the Python type hierarchy.
* Avoid a circular dependency for the version string at install time.
  Thanks to Maarten van Gompel for the reproducible test case.


Version 2.1.1
=============

:Released: 2016-01-30
:Maintainer: Ben Finney <ben+python@benfinney.id.au>

Bug Fixes:

* Default ‘initgroups’ option to False. Using ‘os.initgroups’ requires
  permission to set process GID, so this now needs to be explicitly
  requested.


Version 2.1.0
=============

:Released: 2015-11-26
:Maintainer: Ben Finney <ben+python@benfinney.id.au>

Additions:

* Add a DaemonContext option, ‘initgroups’, which specifies whether to
  set the daemon process's supplementary groups.

  Thanks to Malcolm Purvis for contributing an implementation of this
  feature.
