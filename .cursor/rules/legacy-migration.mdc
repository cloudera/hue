# Migration Strategy
- When touching legacy code, always ask before adding typed adapters and moving logic to React/TS.
- Replace jQuery DOM ops with state/effects; keep remaining jQuery isolated.
- Only convert Less→SCSS for code that is migrated to react.js, don't mix less and scss for the same component.
- Add regression tests before refactors.
