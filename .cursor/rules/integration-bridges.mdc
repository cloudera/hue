# Integration Patterns
- **KO â†’ React**: use `reactWrapper` binding; keep KO observables at boundary.
- **Templates (Mako/HTML)**: mount via `data-reactcomponent` on stable containers.
- **Vue legacy**: do not introduce new Vue; prefer React for new work.

## Pitfalls
- Ensure cuix/antd CSS scope present at React root.
- Avoid dual ownership of DOM by different frameworks.
