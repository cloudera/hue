# A11y Essentials
- Use semantic elements; controls must have accessible names.
- Dialogs: trap focus, restore on close, label/describe properly.
- Announce async states (loading, error, empty); no color-only meanings.
- Use ARIA when elements might not fully describe a complex widget's purpose or behavior
