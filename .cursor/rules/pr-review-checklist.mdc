# PR Review 

## Instructions
â€” Only Output Issues/Improvements, DO NOT list all that is already good.
- Be concise. 
- Provide a general feedback section for issues spanning multiple files, e.g. architectural.
- Provide a section per file with links to the source files.

## Always check for
- Architecture: lift/split state; keep components cohesive.
- Naming clarity: components, functions, variables.
- Edge cases: loading/empty/error; network failures.
- Accessibility: roles, labels, focus, contrast. Only comment where needed, 
- Check for aria- attributes ONLY when needed. e.g. 
  - DO: comment if an icon inly button is missing aria-label. 
  - DON'T: comment about missing aria-disabled if a native disabled attribute is used.
- Copy: concise, consistent; i18n everywhere.
- All files must start with the Cloudera copyright statement

## Make sure that test files
- test main flows
- use userEvent and avoid fireEvent unless realy needed.
- does not test implementation details; assert on behavior and rendered screens.
- use role/name queries, e.g. getByRole rather than getByText
- uses toBeVisible() instead of toBeInTheDocument() where possible
- use the component name in the describe function
- use "it" function over "test" for better readbility


## Make sure the style files
- use BEM notation (avoid unnecessary nesting for classes but allow .antd.cuix on the root)
- never use hardcoded colors; use tokens/variables.
- avoid hardcoded variables for positioning/spacing if possible
- do not contain unnused classes
- use classes over HTML elements whenever possible
