# Build/Dev
- Frontend dev: `npm run dev`, `dev-login`, `dev-workers`.
- Production bundles: `npm run webpack*`.
- Python apps: `make apps` / `make desktop`.
- CI: scripts must be non-interactive and idempotent.

## Checklists
- Register new React roots in relevant imports/bootstrap as required by Hue.
- Keep TS strict; no downlevel that breaks antd/cuix typings.
