      If this is a question rather than a suggested enhancement please use the discussion forum at [hue/discussions](https://github.com/cloudera/hue/discussions) or [discourse.gethue.com](https://discourse.gethue.com/)
      
      Hue is open source so if you are a developer you can also give a go at implementing the enhancement/feature yourself and create a [pull request](https://github.com/cloudera/hue/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) with your code. Don't hesitate to reach out to us if you are interested but feel like you need some help getting started.
