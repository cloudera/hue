"""
Rewrites absolute paths in `.pth` files inside a Python virtualenv to be relative.

Used to ensure that Hue's virtual environments are relocatable across systems.
Complements `virtualenv-make-relocatable` for robust deployment support.

    Converts absolute paths in .pth files to relative paths, relative to the site-packages directory.
