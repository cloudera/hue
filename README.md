Welcome to the repository for Hue
-----------

Hue is an open source Web interface for analyzing data with any Apache Hadoop: [gethue.com](http://gethue.com)

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudera/hue/master/docs/images/hue-screen.png "Hue Screenshot")

It features:

   * SQL Editors for Hive, Impala, MySql, PostGres, Sqlite and Oracle
   * Dynamic search dashboards for Solr
   * Spark Notebooks
   * Browsers for YARN, HDFS, Hive table Metastore, HBase, ZooKeeper
   * Pig Editor, Sqoop2, Oozie workflows Editors and Dashboards
   * Wizards to import data into Hadoop

On top of that, an SDK is available for creating new apps integrated with Hadoop.

More user and developer documentation is available at [gethue.com](http://gethue.com).


Getting Started
-----------
To build and get the development server running:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/cloudera/hue.git
$ cd hue
$ make apps
$ build/env/bin/hue runserver
```
Now Hue should be running on [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) !

The configuration in development mode is ``desktop/conf/pseudo-distributed.ini``.


Note: to start the production server (but lose the automatic reloading after source modification):
```
$ build/env/bin/supervisor
```
To run the tests:

Install the mini cluster (only once):
```
$ ./tools/jenkins/jenkins.sh slow
```

Run all the tests:
```
$ build/env/bin/hue test all
```

Or just some parts of the tests, e.g.:
```
$ build/env/bin/hue test specific impala
$ build/env/bin/hue test specific impala.tests:TestMockedImpala
$ build/env/bin/hue test specific impala.tests:TestMockedImpala.test_basic_flow
```

File Layout
-----------
The Hue "framework" is in ``desktop/core/`` and contains the Web components.
``desktop/libs/`` is the API for talking to various Hadoop services.
The installable apps live in ``apps/``.  Please place third-party dependencies in the app's ext-py/
directory.

The typical directory structure for inside an application includes:
```
  src/
    for Python/Django code
      models.py
      urls.py
      views.py
      forms.py
      settings.py

  conf/
    for configuration (``.ini``) files to be installed

  static/
    for static HTML/js resources and help doc

  templates/
    for data to be put through a template engine

  locales/
    for localizations in multiple languages
```

For the URLs within your application, you should make your own ``urls.py``
which will be automatically rooted at ``/yourappname/`` in the global
namespace.  See ``apps/about/src/about/urls.py`` for an example.


Main Stack
-----------
Hue would not be possible without:

   * Python 2.6.5 - 2.7
   * Django 1.6 (https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.6/)
   * Knockout.js (http://knockoutjs.com/)
   * jQuery (http://jquery.com/)
   * Bootstrap (http://getbootstrap.com/)
