Query. Explore. Share.
----------------------

Hue is a mature open source SQL Assistant for [querying](https://docs.gethue.com/user/querying/) any [Databases & Data Warehouses](https://docs.gethue.com/administrator/configuration/connectors/) and collaborating: [gethue.com](http://gethue.com)

Many companies and organizations use Hue to quickly answer questions via self-service querying e.g.:

* 1000+ customers
* Top Fortune 500

are executing 100s of 1000s of queries daily. It also [ships](https://docs.gethue.com/administrator/installation/) in Cloudera Data Platform, Amazon AWS, Open Data Hub...

Hue is also ideal for building your own [Cloud SQL Editor](https://docs.gethue.com/developer/api/) and any [contributions](https://docs.gethue.com/developer/) are welcome.

Getting Started
---------------

You can start Hue in 3 ways - From source, Docker or Kubernetes. Once setup you would have to configure Hue to connect with the desired database.

The [Forum](https://discourse.gethue.com/) is here in case you are looking for help.

Building From Source
-----------

First, install dependencies, clone Hue repo, build and get the development server running.
[Dependencies documentation](https://docs.gethue.com/administrator/installation/dependencies/) must help you in installing dependencies, and troubleshooting build issues.
```
# Install dependencies
git clone https://github.com/cloudera/hue.git
cd hue
make apps
build/env/bin/hue runserver
```

Now Hue should be running on [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)!

Then, configure Hue to connect to a database for running queries. It is recommended to use MySQL or PostGres for development.

Read more about configurations in the [development documentations](https://docs.gethue.com/developer/development/).

Docker
------
Start Hue in a single click with the [Docker Guide](https://github.com/cloudera/hue/tree/master/tools/docker/hue) or the
[video blog post](http://gethue.com/getting-started-with-hue-in-2-minutes-with-docker/).

    docker run -it -p 8888:8888 gethue/hue:latest

Now Hue should be up and running on your default Docker IP on the port 8888 [http://localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888)!

Read more about configurations [here](https://github.com/cloudera/hue/tree/master/tools/docker/hue#configuration).
