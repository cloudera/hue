Install
-------

    ## Install in any directory, e.g. /home/hue, /usr/share, /home/my_user
    PREFIX=/usr/share make install

    ## If you don't have the permissions, you will need to 'sudo' the command and
    ## make sure that the 'hue' user has write access to the 'logs' directory and 'desktop/desktop.db'.
    ## e.g. sudo chown -R hue:hue /usr/local/hue

    ## Run!
    ${PREFIX}/hue/build/env/bin/supervisor


Upgrade
-------

# Stop the current Hue and do a database backup.
# Install the new Hue to replace the old one and run the database migrations:

    ./build/env/bin/hue migrate
