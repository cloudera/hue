Job Browser
===========

The Job Browser application lets you to examine the Hadoop MapReduce
jobs running on your Hadoop cluster. Job Browser presents the job and
tasks in layers. The top layer is a list of jobs, and you can link to a
list of that job's tasks. You can then view a task's attempts and the
properties of each attempt, such as state, start and end time, and
output size. To troubleshoot failed jobs, you can also view the logs of
each attempt.

Job Browser Installation and Configuration
------------------------------------------

Job Browser is one of the applications installed as part of Hue. For
information about installing and configuring Hue, see the Hue Installation
manual.

Job Browser can display both MRv1 and MRv2 jobs, but must be configured
to display one type at a time. 

Starting Job Browser
--------------------

Click the **Job Browser** icon (![image](images/icon_jobbrowser_24.png))
in the navigation bar at the top of the Hue web page.

If there are no jobs that have been run, the **Welcome to the Job
Browser** page opens, with links to the Job Designer and Beeswax.

If there are jobs running, then the Job Browser list appears.

Filtering the Job Browser List
------------------------------

-   To filter the jobs by their state (such as **Running** or
    **Completed**), choose a state from the **Job status** drop-down
    menu.
-   To filter by a user who ran the jobs, enter the user's name in the
    **User Name** query box.
-   To filter by job name, enter the name in the **Text** query box.
-   To clear the filters, choose **All States** from the **Job status**
    drop-down menu and delete any text in the **User Name** and **Text**
    query boxes.
-   To display retired jobs, check the **Show retired jobs** checkbox.
    Retired jobs show somewhat limited information â€“ for example,
    information on maps and reduces and job duration is not available.
    Jobs are designated as Retired by the JobTracker based on the value
    of mapred.jobtracker.retirejob.interval. The retired jobs no longer
    display after the JobTracker is restarted.
