<p id="docs-internal-guid-63af2251-71ae-f7cf-e3d8-973b2294f38b">
  Hello animal lovers, in <a href="http://gethue.tumblr.com/post/62087732649/hue-3-and-the-new-sqoop-and-zookeeper-apps-are-out">Hue 3</a>, a new application was added in order to make <a href="http://zookeeper.apache.org/">Apache ZooKeeper</a> easier to use: ZooKeeper Browser.
</p>

&nbsp;

The app is not totally new: it consists of a rebasing from Hue 1 to Hue 3 of the [ZooKeeper UI][1] made by Andrei during his Google Summer of Code 3 years ago.

{{< youtube jvlKiZYf9Ys >}}

The main two features are:

- Listing of the ZooKeeper cluster stats and clients
- Browsing and editing of the ZNode hierarchy

&nbsp;

ZooKeeper Browser requires the [ZooKeeper REST][2] service to be running on the same host as ZooKeeper itself. Here is how to set it up:

&nbsp;

First get and build ZooKeeper:

<pre class="code">git clone <a href="https://github.com/apache/zookeeper">https://github.com/apache/zookeeper</a>
cd zookeeper
ant
Buildfile: /home/hue/Development/zookeeper/build.xml

init:
    [mkdir] Created dir: /home/hue/Development/zookeeper/build/classes
    [mkdir] Created dir: /home/hue/Development/zookeeper/build/lib
    [mkdir] Created dir: /home/hue/Development/zookeeper/build/package/lib
    [mkdir] Created dir: /home/hue/Development/zookeeper/build/test/lib

…</pre>

Then start the REST service:

<pre class="code">cd src/contrib/rest
nohup ant run&</pre>

&nbsp;

If ZooKeeper and the REST service are not on the same machine as Hue, please update the [Hue settings][3] and specify the correct hostnames and ports:

&nbsp;

<pre class="code">[zookeeper]

  [[clusters]]

    [[[default]]]
      # Zookeeper ensemble. Comma separated list of Host/Port.
      # e.g. localhost:2181,localhost:2182,localhost:2183
      host_ports=localhost:2181

      # The URL of the REST contrib service
      rest_url=http://localhost:9998</pre>

&nbsp;

And that’s it, jump up to [ZooKeeper Browser][4]!
