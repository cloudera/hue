[Hue 3.6][1] and a team retreat in [Curacao][2] bring the second version of the previous [Search App][3] to some higher standards. The user experience has been greatly improved as now the app provides a very easy way to build custom dashboards and visualizations.

Here is a video demoing how to interactively explore some real Apache Log data coming from the live Hue of [demo.gethue.com][2]. In just a few clicks, we look for pages with errors, what are the most used Hue apps, the top Web Browsers or inspect the user traffic on a gradient colored World map:

**Update!**

New widgets are available in Hue 3.7: <https://gethue.com/search-app-enhancements-explore-even-more-data/>

{{< youtube K6YVZq8wymw >}}

The main features are:

- Dynamic interface updating in live
- Drag & Drop dashboard builder
- Text, Timeline, Pie, Line, Bar, Map, Filters, Grid and HTML widgets
- Solr Index creation wizard from a file

More is on the roadmap, like integration with other Hue apps like Hive/HBase, export/import of results to Hadoop, more data types to plot. A following tutorial presents how to [index the Apache Log][5] into Solr and start doing your own analytics. In the meantime, feel free to give the search dashboards a try with [Hue 3.6][1]  or the upcoming C5.1 package!

As usual, we welcome any feedback on [@gethue][6] or [hue-user][7]!
