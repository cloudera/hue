Hue (3.6 or upcoming CDH5.1) ships with a dynamic dashboard builder for search. We presented the new interface in the previous <a href="https://gethue.com/hadoop-search-dynamic-search-dashboards-with-solr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Search episode</a>.

Here is the second part! We show how to index [Apache][1] log data and recreate the same dashboard in a few clicks. In this video, we are using real Apache logs from [demo.gethue.com][2], the live [Hadoop cluster][3]:

For those wishing to skip to the end, a log file ready to be ingested is available [here][4].

As explained in the [How to Proxy Hue][5] blog post we are getting Apache logs for every page view. We retrieve the logs from the production machine and download the [script][6] that is going to clean them up, extract the Solr schema fields and geolocalize each page.

With this new indexer library we can now install the Hue [search examples][7] without any manual steps. Next features will include automatic geolocalization at query time, indexing of Hive or HBase tables and maybe a [Morphline][8] editor (basically all for getting rid of the Python part and allowing data ingestion of gigabytes or more).

As usual feel free to send any feedback on the [hue-user][9] list or [@gethue][10]!
