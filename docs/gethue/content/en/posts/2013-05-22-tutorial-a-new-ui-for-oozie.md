<p id="docs-internal-guid-49be0c2f-ce57-b599-b202-4938fdfe4c02">
  <a href="http://oozie.apache.org/">Apache Oozie</a> is a great tool for building workflows of Hadoop jobs and scheduling them repeatedly. However, the user experience could be improved. In particular, all the job management happens on the command line and the default UI is readonly and requires a non-Apache licensed javascript library that makes it even more difficult to use.

New Oozie UI

&nbsp;

Here is a short video demo:

{{< youtube wXJzqMQpssc >}}

The UI just sits on top of Oozie like the current Oozie UI. You can download a [release here][1]{.trackLink}.

The [README][2] is available online as well as the source code on [github][3] and details how to install and start the UI.

&nbsp;

Feature list

- Workflows, Coordinators, Bundles dashboards
- Built with standard and current Web technologies
- Filtering, sorting, progress bars, XML highlighting
- Kill, suspend, and re-run jobs from the UI
- One click access to Oozie logs or MapReduce launcher logs
- One click access to the HDFS outputs of the jobs
- Spotlight search about Oozie instrumentation/configuration

&nbsp;

We hope that you give a try to this new standalone UI. In the next version, we can see for providing some packages for a quicker install. As a side note, Oozie users who would like to try a Workflow/Coordinator/Bundle editor could have a look to the [Hue Oozie app][4].

&nbsp;

As usual, we are welcoming any [feedback][5]!
