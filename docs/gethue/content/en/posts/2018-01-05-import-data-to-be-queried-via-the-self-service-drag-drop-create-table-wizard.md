## Create table wizard

If you’ve ever struggled with creating new SQL tables from files, you’ll be happy to learn that this is now much easier. With the latest Hue release, you can now create these in an ad hoc way and thereby expedite self-service analytics. The wizard has been revamped to two simple steps and also offers more formats. Now users just need to:

1. Select a file
2. Select the type of table

And that’s it! Files can be dragged & dropped, selected from HDFS or [S3][1] (if configured), and their formats are automatically detected. The wizard also assists when performing advanced functionalities like table partitioning, Kudu tables, and nested types.

We hope that the new version of Hue makes self-service analytics easier and faster. If you have any questions or feedback, feel free to comment here, on the [user list][2], or via [@gethue][3].

You can find these improvements on the latest Hue or [demo.gethue.com][4]!
