This section goes into greater detail on how to build and reuse the components of Hue.


## Quick Start

### Dependencies

* The OS specific packages are listed in the [install guide](/administrator/installation/dependencies/)
* Python 3.6+ and Django 3 (or Python 2.7 with Django 1.11)
* Vue.js 3
* Node.js ([14.0+](https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_10.x))

### Build & Start

Build once:

    # If you are using Python 3.6+, set PYTHON_VER before the build, like
    export PYTHON_VER=python3.8

    # Mac user might need to set
    export SKIP_PYTHONDEV_CHECK=true

    make apps

The [dependencies documentation](/administrator/installation/dependencies/) is here to help for troubleshooting build issues.

Then start the dev server (which will auto reload on file changes):

    ./build/env/bin/hue runserver

If you are changing JavaScript or CSS files, also start:

    npm run dev

Persistence: Hue needs an existing database with transactions like MySQL to support concurrent requests and also not lose the registered users, saved queries, sharing permissions… when the server gets stopped.

Once build, in order to avoid the `database is locked` errors, you also need to connect Hue to a transactional database. It is recommended to use MySQL or PostGreSQL for development.

Open the `desktop/conf/pseudo-distributed.ini` file in a text editor. Add the following options (and modify accordingly) for your MySQL setup:

Directly below the `[[database]]` line, add the following.

    host=localhost
    port=3306
    engine=mysql
    user=hue
    password=secretpassword
    name=hue

Read more about how [configurations work](/administrator/configuration/).

### First SQL queries!

Here is how to point the Editor to either MySql or [Apache Hive](https://hive.apache.org/) and execute your first SQL queries. For other supported databases refer to the [connectors](/administrator/configuration/connectors/).

#### MySQL

In `desktop/conf/pseudo-distributed.ini`, below the `[[interpreters]]` section of of `[notebook]`.

    [[[mysql]]]
    name=MySQL
    interface=sqlalchemy
    options='{"url": "mysql://${USER}:${PASSWORD}@localhost:3306/hue"}'

#### Apache Hive

You can connect to an existing Hive instance or setup a new one locally. An easy way to setup one is with Docker. You could use this [Hive 2 container](https://github.com/big-data-europe/docker-hive.).

    git clone https://github.com/big-data-europe/docker-hive
    cd docker-hive
    docker-compose up -d

Just follow the above 3 steps and you would have a running Hive instance on `jdbc:hive2://localhost:10000`.

Now under Hue open `desktop/conf/pseudo-distributed.ini` file in a text editor, and modify the following properties:

1. Directly below the `[[beeswax]]` line, add the following:

        # Host where HiveServer2 is running.
        hive_server_host=localhost
        # Port where HiveServer2 Thrift server runs on.
        hive_server_port=10000
        thrift_version=7

2. Below the `[[interpreters]]` of `[notebook]`, add:

        [[[hive]]]
        name=Hive
        interface=hiveserver2

And restart Hue, open the Editors and start typing your first queries!

### Dev environment

#### Lint configs

* [.eslintrc.js](https://github.com/cloudera/hue/blob/master/.eslintrc.js)
* [.pylintrc](https://github.com/cloudera/hue/blob/master/.pylintrc)
* [.prettierrc](https://github.com/cloudera/hue/blob/master/.prettierrc)
* [Git hooks](https://github.com/cloudera/hue/blob/master/tools/githooks)

For checking git commit message format automatically locally:

    cp tools/githooks/* .git/hooks
    chmod +x .git/hooks/*

#### Visual Code

Adding the 'hue' directory as a workspace, then:

Recommended extensions:

* Python - Microsoft
* EsLint - Dirk Baeumur
* Mako - tommorris
* Docker - Microsoft

#### PyCharm

First step is to configure pycharm to use the Hue virtual environment at ./build/env/env
![Pycharm virtualenv](/images/pycharm_virtualenv.png)

Second step is to configure the debug configuration

## Development Process

**Note:**

During the development process if you are facing any problem then, it is recommended to search for information on the [Forum](https://discourse.gethue.com/) and in the [bug tracker](https://github.com/cloudera/hue/issues?q=is%3Aissue+).

Here is a tutorial about how to sent a patch request for review.

### Setup

Hue project uses GitHub Pull Requests (PR) for code reviews. It also automatically runs the CI (syntax check, tests...) for you.

If you've never used git and github before, there are bunch of things you need to [do](https://kbroman.org/github_tutorial/pages/first_time.html) before going further.

Now, clone cloudera/hue:

    git clone https://github.com/cloudera/hue

Create a new branch with the Github issue GH-XXX or explicit name as the branch name:

    git checkout master
    git pull --rebase origin master
    git checkout -b GH-XXX

Then make your changes in code:

    git add <file>
    git diff --cached
    git commit -m "GH-XXX <Ticket summary>"

### Post a review

Either post via the GitHub CLI:

    gh pr create --fill --assignee=romainr --web

Or push to your branch in your repository forks by doing one time:

    git remote add bob https://github.com/cloudera/hue
    git fetch bob

Then just:

    git push bob HEAD:GH-1000-fix

And create the pull request via the button on the https://github.com/cloudera/hue/tree/GH-1000-fix page.

**Note**:
If you have more than one diff, update `HEAD~1..HEAD` accordingly (e.g. `HEAD~2..HEAD`)

In the PR, reference the [GitHub issues](https://github.com/cloudera/hue/issues) if it has one.

### Update a review

Modify the previous commit diff:

    git add <file>
    git commit --amend

Update the review:

    git push bob HEAD:ISSUE-1000-fix -f

And it will automatically kick the CI and notify reviewers.

### Ship It

Once we get ship it from at least one reviewer, we can push the changes to master

    git rebase origin/master
    git push origin HEAD:ci-commit-master-<yourname>

* The push will auto run the tests and push it to master
* It can be seen on https://circleci.com/gh/cloudera/workflows/hue
  * Two builds would be made - One for Python 2.7 and another for Python 3.6
  * If successful, the change would be auto merged to master
  * On failure, we will get a mail
  * Runs usually take 10-20 min
* Once merged mark the review as submitted - **Close > Submitted**
* Add the commit link to the ticket and mark it as resolved


### Sum-up

We hope that these commands will make your life easier and encourage you to [contribute to Hue](https://github.com/cloudera/hue/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) 😉

As usual feel free to send feedback on the [Forum](https://discourse.gethue.com/) list or [GitHub issues](https://github.com/cloudera/hue/issues)!


## API Server

### The Hue Server

![Web Back-end](/images/webbackend.png)

Hue is a web application built on the Django python web framework.
Django, running on the WSGI container/web server (typically CherryPy), manages
the url dispatch, executes application logic code, and puts together the views
from their templates. Django uses a database (typically MySql or PostGres) to manage session data, and Hue applications can use it as well
for their "models". (For example, the saved Editor stores saved queries in the database.)

In addition to the web server, some Hue applications run
daemon processes "on the side". Some examples are the `Celery Task Server`, `Celery Beat`.

![Reference Architecture](/images/hue_architecture.png)

### File Layout

The Hue "framework" is in ``desktop/core/`` and contains the Web components.
``desktop/libs/`` is the API for talking to various Hadoop services.
The installable apps live in ``apps/``.  Please place third-party dependencies in the app's ext-py/
directory.

The typical directory structure for inside an application includes:
```
  src/
    for Python/Django code
      models.py
      urls.py
      views.py
      forms.py
      settings.py

  conf/
    for configuration (``.ini``) files to be installed

  static/
    for static HTML/js resources and help doc

  templates/
    for data to be put through a template engine

  locales/
    for localizations in multiple languages
```

For the URLs within your application, you should make your own ``urls.py``
which will be automatically rooted at ``/yourappname/`` in the global
namespace. See ``apps/about/src/about/urls.py`` for an example.

### Configurations

#### File

Hue uses a typed configuration system that reads configuration files (in an
ini-style format).  By default, Hue loads all `*.ini` files in the `build/desktop/conf`
directory.  The configuration files have the following format:

    # This is a comment
    [ app_name ]          # Same as your app's name
    app_property = "Pink Floyd"

    [[ section_a ]]         # The double brackets start a section under [ app_name ]
    a_weight = 80         # that is useful for grouping
    a_height = 180

    [[ filesystems ]]       # Sections are also useful for making a list
    [[[ cluster_1 ]]]       # All list members are sub-sections of the same type
    namenode_host = localhost
    # User may define more:
    # [[[ cluster_2 ]]]
    # namenode_host = 10.0.0.1


#### Variables

Your application's `conf.py` is special. It provides access to the configuration file (and even
default configurations not specified in the file). Using the above example, your `conf.py` should
define the following:

A `desktop.lib.conf.Config` object for `app_property`, such as:

    MY_PROPERTY = Config(key='app_property', default='Beatles', help='blah')

  You can access its value by `MY_PROPERTY.get()`.

A `desktop.lib.conf.ConfigSection` object for `section_a`, such as:

    SECTION_A = ConfigSection(key='section_a',
          help='blah',
          members=dict(
            AWEIGHT=Config(key='a_weight', type=int, default=0),
            AHEIGHT=Config(key='a_height', type=int, default=0)))

  You can access the values by `SECTION_A.AWEIGHT.get()`.

A `desktop.lib.conf.UnspecifiedConfigSection` object for `filesystems`, such as:

    FS = UnspecifiedConfigSection(
        key='filesystems',
        each=ConfigSection(members=dict(
            nn_host=Config(key='namenode_host', required=True))


### Saving documents

Each app used to have its own model to store its data (e.g. a saving a SQL query, query history...). All the models have been unified into a single Document2 model in the desktop app:

``desktop/core/src/desktop/models.py``.

The `Document2` model provides automatically creation, sharing and saving. It persists the document data into a json field, which limits the need ot database migrations and simplifies the interaction with the frontend.

`Document2` is based on [Django Models](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/#the-model-layer)
are Django's Object-Relational Mapping framework.

### Authentication Backends

Hue exposes a configuration flag ("auth") to configure a custom authentication [backend](https://github.com/cloudera/hue/blob/master/desktop/core/src/desktop/auth/backend.py).
See [writing an authentication backend](http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/auth/#writing-an-authentication-backend)
for more details.

In addition to that, backends may support a `manages_passwords_externally()` method, returning True or False, to tell the user manager application whether or not changing passwords within Hue is possible.

### Using and Installing Thrift

Right now, we check in the generated thrift code.
To generate the code, you'll need the thrift binary version 0.9.0.
Please download from http://thrift.apache.org/.

The modules using ``Thrift`` have some helper scripts like ``regenerate_thrift.sh``
for regenerating the code from the interfaces.

### Upgrades

After upgrading the version of Hue, running these two commands will make sure the database has the correct tables and fields.

    ./build/env/bin/hue migrate

### Debugging Tips and Tricks

* Set `DESKTOP_DEBUG=1` as an environment variable if you want logs to go to stderr
  as well as to the respective log files.
* Use runserver.  If you want to set a CLI breakpoint, just insert
  `__import__("ipdb").set_trace()`
  into your code.
* Django tends to restart its server whenever it notices a file changes.  For
  certain things (like configuration changes), this is not sufficient.  Restart
  the server whole-heartedly.
* We recommend developing with the Chrome console.

* Special environment variables

    DESKTOP_LOGLEVEL=<level>
      level can be DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, or CRITICAL.
      When specified, the console logger is set to the given log level. A console
      logger is created if one is not defined.

    DESKTOP_DEBUG
      A shorthand for DESKTOP_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG. Also turns on output HTML
      validation.

    DESKTOP_PROFILE
      Turn on Python profiling. The profile data is saved in a file. See the
      console output for the location of the file.

    DESKTOP_LOG_DIR=$dir
      Specify the HUE log directory. Defaults to ./log.

    DESKTOP_DB_CONFIG=$db engine:db name:test db name:username:password:host:port
      Specify alternate DB connection parameters for HUE to use. Useful for
      testing your changes against, for example, MySQL instead of sqlite. String
      is a colon-delimited list.

    TEST_IMPALAD_HOST=impalad-01.gethue.com
      Point to an Impalad and trigger the Impala tests.

## User Interface (UI)

Developing applications for Hue requires a minimal amount of CSS
(and potentially JavaScript) to use existing functionality.

In a nutshell, front-end development is using:

* [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) to script the custom interactions
* TypeScript
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) to layout your app
* [Mako](http://www.makotemplates.org/) is the templating language (currently being removed in favor of Vue.js))

### Javascript

The javascript files are currently being migrated to webpack bundles, during this process some files will live under src/desktop/static/ and some will live under src/desktop/js

For changes to the files under src/desktop/js the following applies:

First make sure all third-party dependencies defined in package.json are installed into node_modules/

    npm install

Also run this after making changes to package.json, adding new third-party dependencies etc.

To generate the js bundles run:

    npm run webpack
    npm run webpack-workers
    npm run webpack-login

During development the bundles can be autogenerated when it detects changes to the .js files, for this run:

    npm run dev

Before sending a review with changes to the bundles run:

    npm run lint-fix

and possibly fix any issues it might report.

### CSS / LESS

Hue uses [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) version 2.0 CSS
styles and layouts. They are highly reusable and flexible. Your app doesn't
have to use these styles, but if you do, it'll save you some time and make your
app look at home in Hue.

After changing the CSS in a .less file, rebuilding with:

    npm run less

Or run in watch mode that will generate the .css on any change to the .less files:

    npm run less-dev

After less changes make sure linting is run with:

    npm run less-lint

### Icons

You should create an icon for your application that is a transparent png sized
24px by 24px. Your `settings.py` file should point to your icon via the `ICON`
variable. The `create_desktop_app` command creates a default icon for you.

<div class="note">
  If you do not define an application icon, your application will not show up
  in the navigation bar.
</div>

Hue ships with Twitter Bootstrap and Font Awesome 3 (http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/)
so you have plenty of scalable icons to choose from. You can style your elements to use them
like this (in your mako template):

    <!-- show a trash icon in a link -->
    <a href="#something"><i class="icon-trash"></i> Trash</a>

### Static files

For better performances, Hue uses the Django staticfiles app. If in production mode, if you edit
some static files, you would need to run this command or `make apps`. No actions are needed in
development mode.
```
./build/env/bin/hue collectstatic
```

## Testing

### The short story

Run the API unit tests

    ./build/env/bin/hue test unit

Open a pull request which will automatically trigger a [CircleCi](https://circleci.com/gh/cloudera/hue) unit test run.

How to run just some parts of the tests, e.g.:

    build/env/bin/hue test specific impala
    build/env/bin/hue test specific impala.tests:TestMockedImpala
    build/env/bin/hue test specific impala.tests:TestMockedImpala.test_basic_flow

Run the user interface tests:

    npm run test

### Running the API tests

The ``test`` management command prepares the arguments (test app names) and passes them to nose (django_nose.nose_runner). Nose will then magically find all the tests to run.

Tests themselves should be named `*_test.py`.  These will be found as long as they're in packages covered by django.  You can use the
unittest frameworks, or you can just name your method with the word "test" at a word boundary, and nose will find it. See `apps/hello/src/hello/hello_test.py` for an example.

To run the unit tests (should take 5-10 minutes):

    build/env/bin/hue test fast

To run all the tests (unit and integration), use:

    build/env/bin/hue test all

To run only tests of a particular app, use:

    build/env/bin/hue test specific <app>

e.g.

    build/env/bin/hue test specific filebrowser

To run a specific test, use:

    build/env/bin/hue test specific <app><module>:<test_func>
    build/env/bin/hue test specific <app><module>:<class>

e.g.

    build/env/bin/hue test specific useradmin.tests:test_user_admin
    build/env/bin/hue test specific useradmin.tests:AdminTest

To run a specific test in a class, use:

    build/env/bin/hue test specific <app><module>:<class><test_func>

Note:

When running the tests and seeing an error similar to:

    ...
    ValueError: The file 'desktop/js/bundles/hue/vendors~hue~notebook~tableBrowser-chunk-f7c8562ecf79bc8f1f16.js' could not be found with <django.contrib.staticfiles.storage.CachedStaticFilesStorage object at 0x7faf77042630>.


Re-building the collection of static files should fix it:

    ./build/env/bin/hue collectstatic

### Running the UI tests

The tests are next to the file under test, the filename of the test has to end with `.test.ts` or `.test.js`.

    someFile.js         <- File under test
    someFile.test.ts    <- File containing tests

Run all the tests once with:

    npm test

Run tests from a specific file once:

    npm test -- foo.test.js

To run the tests in watch mode:

    npm run test-dev

While in watch mode Jest will detect changes to all files and re-run related tests. There are
also options to target specific files or tests. Press 'w' in the console to see the options.

In order to update the test snapshots, let the first checks of tests complete and then
press 'u' in the console to update the snapshots.

Note: on certain OS like Ubuntu, running the tests via a global jest seems to not hang your system

    npm install jest --global

e.g.

    jest calciteAutocompleteParser.Select.stream.test.js --testPathIgnorePatterns=[]
    jest calciteAutocompleteParser --testPathIgnorePatterns=[]

How to update snapshot tests:

    jest --updateSnapshot

#### Testing KO Js components

koSetup provides utilities to test Knockout components and bindings using `jsdom` from `jest`.

An example of component test:

    import { koSetup } from 'jest/koTestUtils';

    import 'ko/someComponent';

    describe('ko.someComponent.js', () => {
      const setup = koSetup(); // Adds the necessary setup and teardown

      it('should render component', async () => {
        const someParams = {}

        const element = await setup.renderComponent('someComponent', someParams);

        expect(element.innerHTML).toMatchSnapshot();
      });

      it('should change after observable update', async () => {
        const someParams = { visible: ko.observable(false) };
        const wrapper = await setup.renderComponent('someComponent', someParams);
        expect(wrapper.querySelector('[data-test="some-test-id"]').style['display']).toEqual('none');

        someParams.visible(true); // Or trigger some event on an elmement etc.
        await setup.waitForKoUpdate(); // Waits for re-render

        expect(wrapper.querySelector('[data-test="some-test-id"]').style['display']).toEqual('inline-block');
      });
    });

An example of a binding test:

    import ko from 'knockout';
    import { koSetup } from 'jest/koTestUtils';
    import './ko.myBinding';

    describe('ko.myBinding.js', () => {
      const setup = koSetup();

      it('should toggle observable', async () => {
        const viewModel = { testObservable: ko.observable(false) };
        const wrapper = await setup.renderKo(
          '<div class="click-test" data-bind="myBinding: testObservable"></div>',
          viewModel
        );

        expect(viewModel.testObservable()).toBeFalsy();

        wrapper.querySelector('.click-test').click();
        await setup.waitForKoUpdate();

        expect(viewModel.testObservable()).toBeTruthy();
      });
    });


### Coverage

Add the following options:

    ./build/env/bin/hue test unit --with-xunit --with-cover

For js run:

    npm run test-coverage

### Continuous Integration (CI)

[CircleCi](https://circleci.com/gh/cloudera/hue) automatically run the unit tests (Python, Javascript, linting) on branch updates and pull requests. Branches containing `ci-commit-master` will try to be auto pushed to master if the run is green and the Github permissions match.
This logic is described in the [config.yml](https://github.com/cloudera/hue/tree/master/.circleci).

The runs happen in an image based on [latest Hue's image](https://hub.docker.com/u/gethue/).

Note: until the `desktop/ext-py` dependencies are moved to a `requirement.txt`, adding new Python modules will require adding them first to the Docker image by building a Hue branch which has them.

### Integration tests

To not fail on integration tests, Hue would need to be configured to point to a live cluster, or you could install the mini cluster (only once) with:

    ./tools/jenkins/jenkins.sh slow

Note: the integration tests are going to be ported to a more modern CI with dependencies provided by containers.

Those are tagged with `integration` either at the class or method level:

    class BeeswaxSampleProvider(object):
      integration = True

      @attr('integration')
      def test_add_ldap_users_case_sensitivity(self):
        if is_live_cluster():
          raise SkipTest('GH-2897: Cannot yet guarantee database is case sensitive')

        ...

## Releasing

The checklist below details the steps. Then send the release notes to the [Forum](https://discourse.gethue.com/) and https://twitter.com/gethue!

Also update https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Hue_(Software).

### Version

Here is an example of [release commit](https://github.com/cloudera/hue/commit/9de217d6b6).

Update the versions to the next release (current release +1):

    :100644 100644 4db6d5f... f907d04... M	VERSION
    :100644 100644 9332f95... 45b28ad... M	desktop/libs/librdbms/java/pom.xml
    :100644 100644 551f62f... 694f021... M	maven/pom.xml
    :100644 100644 658d54a... 671ce01... M  package.json

How to count the number of commits since the last release:

    git log --oneline --since=2020-01-01 | grep 'release' -n -i
    git log --oneline -449 > commits.txt

    cat commits.txt | sed 's/\(HUE\-[[:digit:]][[:digit:]][[:digit:]][[:digit:]]\)/\[\1\]\(https:\/\/issues.cloudera.org\/browse\/\1\)/' | sed 's/^\(.*\)/* \1/' > commits.md

And add them and the authors to the release notes:

    git log --pretty="%an" | sort | uniq | sed 's/^\(.*\)/* \1/' > authors.txt

### Git

Pushing the release branch:

    git push origin HEAD:branch-4.9.0

Tagging the release:

    git tag -a release-4.9.0 -m "release-4.9.0"
    git push origin release-4.9.0

Draft a new release on https://github.com/cloudera/hue/releases.

Publish Github NPM package and Docker images at https://github.com/orgs/cloudera/packages?repo_name=hue.

### Gethue

Building the tarball release:

    git checkout -b release-4.9.0 release-4.9.0
    make prod

You might need to upgrade the [Mysqlclient](https://docs.gethue.com/administrator/installation/dependencies/#mysql--mariadb) if seeing:

    _mysql.c:44:10: fatal error: my_config.h: No such file or directory
      44 | #include "my_config.h"
          |          ^~~~~~~~~~~~~

Source of the release: https://github.com/cloudera/hue/archive/release-4.9.0.zip

Push to the CDN:

    scp hue-4.9.0.tgz root@cdn.gethue.com:/var/www/cdn.gethue.com/downloads

### Docker

Docker images are at https://hub.docker.com/u/gethue/:

    docker build https://github.com/cloudera/hue.git#release-4.9.0 -t gethue/hue:4.9.0 -f tools/docker/hue/Dockerfile
    docker tag gethue/hue:4.9.0 gethue/hue:latest
    docker images
    docker login -u gethue
    docker push gethue/hue
    docker push gethue/hue:4.9.0

    docker build https://github.com/cloudera/hue.git#release-4.9.0 -t gethue/nginx:4.9.0 -f tools/docker/nginx/Dockerfile;
    docker tag gethue/nginx:4.9.0 gethue/nginx:latest
    docker push gethue/nginx
    docker push gethue/nginx:4.9.0


### Kubernetes / Helm package

To build the chart, use the package command from the Helm root directory:

    cd hue/tools/kubernetes/helm/
    helm package hue

Then to publish it to the outside via the current Apache server:

    scp hue-1.0.1.tgz root@101.200.100.200:/var/www/helm.gethue.com

Then connect to the server and index the package:

    ssh root@101.200.100.200
    cd /var/www/helm.gethue.com
    helm repo index .

### Documentation

Documentation is currently being auto refreshed every morning of the week and run as a container.

The manual process otherwise would be to [build it](#Documentation) and push it to the docs host.

### NPM registry

To publish gethue to the [NPM registry](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gethue), the following command would have to be run.

    npm run publish-gethue

## Building

### Custom Webpack Config

You can make webpack build with custom configuration files by setting HUE_WEBPACK_CONFIG environment variable.

    HUE_WEBPACK_CONFIG="webpack.config.custom.js" make apps

### Dev Docker

Try basic changes [in 3 minutes](https://gethue.com/quick-start-a-hue-development-environment-in-3-minutes-with-docker/) without compiling Hue locally hence avoiding the setting up of [dependencies](/developer/):

    git clone https://github.com/cloudera/hue.git
    cd hue
    cp desktop/conf/pseudo-distributed.ini.tmpl desktop/conf/pseudo-distributed.ini

Then edit the `[[database]]` section to specify a proper database, here MySql:

    host=127.0.0.1 # Don't use 'localhost' if Docker
    engine=mysql
    user=hue
    password=hue
    name=huedb

Then map the local Hue source code into the running container (so that local edits are seen in the running Hue):

    sudo docker run -it -v $PWD/apps:/usr/share/hue/apps -v $PWD/desktop:/usr/share/hue/desktop -v $PWD/desktop/conf/pseudo-distributed.ini:/usr/share/hue/desktop/conf/z-hue.ini --network="host" gethue/hue

Note: code updates won’t be seen after the Docker container runs. For this Hue would need to be started in dev server mode by replacing the [line](https://github.com/cloudera/hue/blob/master/tools/docker/hue/startup.sh#L5) by

    ./build/env/bin/hue runserver 0.0.0.0:8888

and recompiling the Docker image. It will then auto-restart on Python code changes. For JavaScript, those would need to be [compiled](/developer/development/#javascript).


### Documentation

Install [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/). Each page has a link to its own source file in the top right corner.

Build the [source](https://github.com/cloudera/hue/tree/master/docs/docs-site) and see live changes:

    cd docs/docs-site

    hugo serve

Check for links not working (e.g. returning a 404) with muffet, a fast link checker crawler. It recommended to use the [check links script](https://github.com/cloudera/hue/blob/master/tools/ci/check_for_website_dead_links.sh).

The posts [manual](https://gethue.com/easily-checking-for-deadlinks-on-docs-gethue-com/) and [continuous integration](https://gethue.com/easily-checking-for-deadlinks-on-docs-gethue-com/) contain more information about it.

And then to build the static site just do:

    hugo

and grab the `public` directory.

### gethue.com Blog & Website

Like for the [Documentation](#documentation-1) install hugo. The content for each language is in its [own directory](https://github.com/cloudera/hue/tree/master/docs/gethue/content).

Blog posts are located in [docs/gethue/content/en/posts](https://github.com/cloudera/hue/tree/master/docs/gethue/content/en/posts). Here is an example of the source of a [release post](https://github.com/cloudera/hue/commit/fcc0078a4ba59e450a2e081ad0cc27e482a8703b#diff-9b1261f162231be68d3c30329e73b458c874858c0d685cf0c213fdace3309679).

Build it and see live changes:

    cd docs/gethue

    hugo serve

Will automatically start one server for each language domain.

gethue.com refresh is currently manually kicked but this will be automated soon.

## SQL Parsers

The parsers are the flagship part of Hue and power extremely advanced autocompletes and other [SQL functionalities](/user/querying/#autocomplete). They are running on the client side and comes with just a few megabytes of JavaScript that are cached by the browser. This provides a very reactive experience to the end user and allows to [import them](#reusing-a-parser-in-your-project) as classic JavaScript modules for your own development needs.

While the dynamic content like the list of tables, columns is obviously fetched via [remote endpoints](/administrator/configuration/connectors/), all the SQL knowledge of the statements is available.

The main dialects are:

*  Apache Hive
*  Apache Impala
*  Presto
*  Apache Calcite

But there are more! See all the currently shipped [SQL dialects](https://github.com/cloudera/hue/tree/master/desktop/core/src/desktop/js/parse/sql).

This guide takes you through the steps necessary to create an autocompleter for any [SQL dialect](/administrator/configuration/connectors/#databases) in Hue. The major benefits are:

* Proposing only valid syntax in the autocomplete
* Getting the list of tables, columns, UDFs... automatically
* Suggesting fixes
* Diffing, formatting... queries

**Looking at quick code examples?**

- Adding `SHOW` syntax to Flink SQL [GH-1399](https://github.com/cloudera/hue/issues/1399)
- Adding a Dask SQL parser and connector [GH-1480](https://github.com/cloudera/hue/issues/1480)

### Parser Theory

There are several parsers in Hue already (e.g. one for Impala, one for Hive..) and a generic SQL that is used for other dialects. The parsers are written using a [bison](https://www.gnu.org/software/bison/) grammar and are generated with [jison](https://github.com/zaach/jison). They arere 100% Javascript and live on the client side, this gives the performance of a desktop editor in your browser.

Building a dedicated work is more effort but it then allows a very rich end user experience, e.g.:

* Handle invalid/incomplete queries and propose suggestions/fixes
* date_column = <Date compatible UDF ...>
* Language reference or data samples just by pointing the cursor on SQL identifiers
* Leverage the parser for risk alerts (e.g. adding automatic LIMIT) or proper re-formatting

#### Structure

Normally parsers generate a parse tree but for our purposes we don’t really care about the statement itself but rather about what should happen when parts of a particular statement is encountered. During parsing the state is kept outside the parse tree and in case of syntax errors this enables us to provide some results up to the point of the error. There are two ways that incomplete/erroneous statements are handled, first we try to define most of the incomplete grammar and secondly we rely on the “error” token which allows the parser to recover.

The parsers provide one function, parseSql, that accepts the text before the cursor and the text after the cursor as arguments. The function returns an object containing instructions on what to suggest given the input.

As an example:

    sqlParserRepository.getAutocompleteParser('impala').then(parser => {
      console.log(parser.parseSql('SELECT * FROM customers'));
    });

Would output something like:

    {
      definitions: [],
      locations: (6) [{…}, {…}, {…}, {…}, {…}, {…}],
      lowerCase: false,
      suggestAggregateFunctions: {tables: [Array(1)]},
      suggestAnalyticFunctions: true,
      suggestColumns: {source: "select", tables: [{identifierChain: [{name: "customers"}]}]},
      suggestFunctions: {},
      suggestKeywords: (8) [{…}, {…}, {…}, {…}, {…}, {…}, {…}, {…}]
    }

We take this output and link it to various sources of metadata to provide the list of suggestions the user finally sees. In this case we’d use the data from “suggestColumns” to call the backend for all the columns of the “customers” table. We’d also use the functions library to list all the UDFs etc.

Here’s a list of some of the different types of suggestions the parser can identify:

    suggestAggregateFunctions
    suggestAnalyticFunctions
    suggestColRefKeywords
    suggestColumnAliases
    suggestColumns
    suggestCommonTableExpressions
    suggestDatabases
    suggestFilters
    suggestFunctions
    suggestGroupBys	suggestHdfs
    suggestIdentifiers
    suggestJoinConditions
    suggestJoins
    suggestKeywords
    suggestOrderBys
    suggestSetOptions
    suggestTables
    suggestValues

Parsers are generated and added to the repository using the command generateParsers.js under tools/jison/. To for instance generate all the Impala parsers you would run the following command in the hue folder:

    cd tools/jison
    node generateParsers.js impala

In reality two parsers are generated per dialect, one for syntax and one for autocomplete. The syntax parsers is a subset of the autocomplete parser with no error recovery and without the autocomplete specific grammar.

All the jison grammar files can be found [here](https://github.com/cloudera/hue/tree/master/desktop/core/src/desktop/js/parse/jison/sql) and the generated parsers are also committed together with their tests [here](https://github.com/cloudera/hue/tree/master/desktop/core/src/desktop/js/parse/sql).

Parsers are sharing a maximum of the common syntax via some modules so that it is easy to improve the specificness of any of them while not starting from sratch.

e.g. in [structure.json](https://github.com/cloudera/hue/blob/master/desktop/core/src/desktop/js/parse/jison/sql/hive/structure.json):

    {
      "lexer": "sql.jisonlex",
      "autocomplete": [
        "../generic/autocomplete_header.jison",
        "abort/abort_transactions.jison",
        "common/table_constraint.jison",
        "alter/alter_common.jison",
        "alter/alter_database.jison",
        "alter/alter_index.jison",
        "alter/alter_materialized_view.jison",
        "alter/alter_table.jison",
        "alter/alter_view.jison",
        "analyze/analyze_table.jison",
        ...
      ],
      "syntax": [
        "../generic/syntax_header.jison",
        "abort/abort_transactions.jison",
        "common/table_constraint.jison",
        "alter/alter_common.jison",
        "alter/alter_database.jison",
        "alter/alter_index.jison",
        "alter/alter_materialized_view.jison",
        ...
      ]
    }

#### The grammar

In a regular SQL parser you might define the grammar of a select statement like this:

    SelectStatement
      : 'SELECT' ColumnList 'FROM' Identifier
      ;

    ColumnList
      : Identifier
      | ColumnList ',' Identifier
      ;

This would be able to parse a statement like 'SELECT a, b, c FROM some_table' (depending on lexer definitions of course).

#### Notion of cursor

To turn this into an autocompleter we add the notion of a cursor. Often, the user has the cursor somewhere in the statement. In the previous section, we were assuming that the query was already typed and the user had not mouse cursor within it.

The cursor is represented as an obscure character that is unlikely to be used in a statement. Currently '\u2020' was picked, the dagger, identified as 'CURSOR' in the lexer. The actual parsed string is therefore beforeCursor + '\u2020' + afterCursor.

For the statement above we’d add an extra rule with an _EDIT postfix like this:

    SelectStatement
      : 'SELECT' ColumnList 'FROM' Identifier
      ;

    SelectStatement_EDIT
      : 'CURSOR' --> { suggestKeywords: ['SELECT'] }
      | 'SELECT' ColumnList_EDIT
      | 'SELECT' ColumnList 'CURSOR' --> { suggestKeywords: ['FROM'] }
      | 'SELECT' ColumnList 'FROM' 'CURSOR'  --> { suggestTables: {} }
      | 'SELECT' ColumnList_EDIT 'FROM' Identifier --> { suggestColumns: { table: $4 } }
      ;

So for example if a cursor without any text is encountered, it will tell us to suggest the 'SELECT' keyword etc.

#### Why an extra space

The extra space is just for the documentation to show the complete output with locations, it should indeed be clarified a bit. The reason for the extra space is that the parser ignores partial words, consider the following where | denotes the cursor:

    SELECT * FROM som|

The parser will treat this as "SELECT * FROM |" and it leaves it up to the editor logic to filter any tables, starting with "som".

### Tutorial: Creating a parser

The goal is to create from scratch a new parser for the PostgreSQL database.

#### Prerequisites

Make sure you have [jison](/developer/development/#sql-autocomplete) installed and a [development](/administrator/installation/dependencies/) Hue. Then configure a [PostgreSQL interpreter](/administrator/configuration/connectors/#postgresql).

In the Hue folder:

    ./build/env/bin/pip install psycopg2-binary

and edit your hue config desktop/conf/pseudo-distributed.ini to contain:

    [notebook]
    [[interpreters]]
    [[[postgresql]]]
    name = postgresql
    interface=sqlalchemy
    options='{"url": "postgresql://hue:hue@localhost:31335/hue"}'

Our generateParsers tool can take an existing dialect and setup the source code for a new parsers based on that.

In the hue folder run:

    cd tools/jison
    npm install
    node generateParsers.js -new generic postgresql

After the -new argument you specify an existing dialect to clone first and then the name of the new parser.

Once executed the tool has cloned the generic parser with tests and generated a new postgresql parsers. The jison files can be found under `desktop/core/src/desktop/js/parse/jison/sql/postgresql/` and the testscan be found in `desktop/core/src/desktop/js/parse/sql/postgresql/test`.

To regenerate the parsers after changes to the jison files run:

    cd tools/jison
    node generateParsers.js postgresql

The tool will report any problems with the grammar. Note that it might still generate a parser if the grammar isn’t ambiguous but it’s likely that there will be test failures.

#### Extending the grammar

This gives you an idea on how to add custom syntax to the newly generated postgresql parser. For this example we’ll add the [REINDEX](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/sql-reindex.html) statement as it’s quite simple.

    REINDEX { INDEX | TABLE | DATABASE | SYSTEM } name [ FORCE ]

We’ll start by adding a test, in `postgresqlAutocompleteParser.test.js` in the test folder inside the main describe function before the first `it('should...`:

    describe('REINDEX', () => {
      it('should handle "REINDEX TABLE foo FORCE; |"', () => {
        assertAutoComplete({
          beforeCursor: 'REINDEX TABLE foo FORCE;  ',
          afterCursor: '',
          noErrors: true,
          containsKeywords: ['SELECT'],
          expectedResult: {
            lowerCase: false
          }
        });
      });

      it('should suggest keywords for "REINDEX |"', () => {
        assertAutoComplete({
          beforeCursor: 'REINDEX ',
          afterCursor: '',
          noErrors: true,
          containsKeywords: ['INDEX', 'DATABASE'],
          expectedResult: {
            lowerCase: false
          }
        });
      });
    });

When we now run `npm run test -- postgresqlAutocompleteParser.test.js` there should be two failing tests.

Alternatively, if using Jest directly and working on parsers currently being skipped in the CI, provide matching file names and an empty blacklist file pattern. e.g.:

    jest calciteAutocompleteParser.Select.stream.test.js --testPathIgnorePatterns=[]
    jest calciteAutocompleteParser --testPathIgnorePatterns=[]

Next we’ll have to add the keyword to the lexer, let’s open `sql.jisonlex` in the jison folder for postgresql and add the following new tokens:

    'REINDEX'                                  { parser.determineCase(yytext); return 'REINDEX'; }
    'INDEX'                                    { return 'INDEX'; }
    'SYSTEM'                                   { return 'SYSTEM'; }
    'FORCE'                                    { return 'FORCE'; }

Now let’s add the grammar, starting with the complete specification. For simplicity we’ll add it in `sql_main.jison`, at the bottom of the file add:

    DataDefinition
    : ReindexStatement
    ;

    ReindexStatement
    : 'REINDEX' ReindexTarget RegularOrBacktickedIdentifier OptionalForce
    ;

    ReindexTarget
    : 'INDEX'
    | 'TABLE'
    | 'DATABASE'
    | 'SYSTEM'
    ;

    OptionalForce
    :
    | 'FORCE'
    ;

"DataDefinition" is an existing rule and this extends that rule with "ReindexStatement".

Save the files and first run `node tools/jison/generateParsers.js postgresql` then `npm run test -- postgresqlAutocompleteParser.test.js` and we should be down to one failing test.

For the next one we’ll add some keyword suggestions after the user has typed REINDEX, we’ll continue below the ReindexStatement in `sql_main.jison`:

    DataDefinition_EDIT
    : ReindexStatement_EDIT
    ;

    ReindexStatement_EDIT
    : 'REINDEX' 'CURSOR'
      {
        parser.suggestKeywords(['DATABASE', 'INDEX', 'SYSTEM', 'TABLE']);
      }
    ;

Again, run `cd  tools/jison/; node generateParsers.js postgresql` then `npm run test -- postgresqlAutocompleteParser.test.js` and the tests should both be green.

We also want the autocompleter to suggest the keyword REINDEX when the user hasn’t typed anything, to do that let’s first add the following test with the other new ones in `postgresqlAutocompleteParser.test.js`:

    it('should suggest REINDEX for "|"', () => {
      assertAutoComplete({
        beforeCursor: '',
        afterCursor: '',
        noErrors: true,
        containsKeywords: ['REINDEX'],
        expectedResult: {
          lowerCase: false
        }
      });
    });

For this to pass we need to add REINDEX to the list of DDL and DML keywords in the file `sqlParseSupport.js` next to the generated parser (`desktop/core/src/desktop/js/parse/sql/postgresql/sqlParseSupport.js/`). Find the function `parser.suggestDdlAndDmlKeywords` and add ‘REINDEX’ to the keywords array. Now run `npm run test -- postgresqlAutocompleteParser.test.js` and the three tests should pass.

Before you continue further, note that in this case there will be two new failing tests where the keyword ‘REINDEX’ has to be added.

In order to use the newly generated parsers we have to add them to the webpack bundles:

    npm run webpack
    npm run webpack-workers

While developing it will speed up if the webpack bundling runs in the background, for this open two terminal sessions and run `npm run dev` in one and `npm run dev-workers` in the other. It will then monitor changes to the files and build a lot quicker.

After the bundling you can now test it directly in the editor!

### Syntax highlighting

New keywords might not be properly colored highlighted in the editor. This is especially true when adding a new language. Here is how to fix that.

![Missing highlighting](https://cdn.gethue.com/docs/dev/syntax_highlighting_missing.png)

Missing highlighting for 'REINDEX' keyword

![With highlighting](https://cdn.gethue.com/docs/dev/syntax_highlighting_updated.png)

With correct highlighting

#### Updating keywords

The Editor is currently visually powered by [Ace](https://ace.c9.io). The list of supported languages is found in the [mode](https://github.com/cloudera/hue/tree/master/tools/ace-editor/lib/ace/mode) directory.

For each dialect, we have two files. e.g. with PostgreSQL:

    pgsql.js
    pgsql_highlight_rules.js

The list of keywords is present in `*_highlight_rules.js` and can be updated there.

    var keywords = (
        "ALL|ALTER|REINDEX|..."
    )

Afterwards, run:

    make ace

And after refreshing the editor page, the updated mode will be activated.

#### Adding new dialect

To add a new dialect, it is recommended to copy the two files of the closest mode and rename all the names inside. For example, if we were creating a new `ksql` mode, `pgsql_highlight_rules.js` would become `ksql_highlight_rules.js` and we would rename all the references inside to `psql` to `ksql`. Same with `pgsql.js` to `ksql.js`. In particular, the name of the mode to be referenced later is in:

    KsqlHighlightRules.metaData = {
      fileTypes: ["ksql"],
      name: "ksql",
      scopeName: "source.ksql"
    };

Tip: inheritance of modes is supported by Ace, which make it handy for avoiding potential duplications.

In the Editor, the mapping between Ace's modes and the type of snippets is happening in [editor_components.mako](https://github.com/cloudera/hue/blob/master/desktop/libs/notebook/src/notebook/templates/editor_components.mako#L2118).

In the KSQL case we have:

    ksql: {
      placeHolder: '${ _("Example: SELECT * FROM stream, or press CTRL + space") }',
      aceMode: 'ace/mode/ksql',
      snippetIcon: 'fa-database',
      sqlDialect: true
    },

And cf. above [prerequisites](#prerequisites), any interpreter snippet with `ksql` will pick-up the new highlighter:

    [[[ksql]]]
    name=KSQL Analytics
    interface=ksql

### Reusing a parser in your project

The parsers ship as a pluggable [component](/developer/components/parsers).


## Connectors

Connectors provide pluggable integration to any external data service so that an admin can easily allow end users to interact with them.

* List of all the [existing connectors](/administrator/configuration/connectors/)
* Check "Potential connectors" ideas in each section
* Feel free to contact the [community](https://discourse.gethue.com/c/developer-sdk-api)

### Databases

#### SqlAlchemy

[SqlAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org) is the prefered way if the Hive API is not supported by the database. The core implementation is in [`sql_alchemy.py`](https://github.com/cloudera/hue/blob/master/desktop/libs/notebook/src/notebook/connectors/sql_alchemy.py) and relies on each respective SqlAlchemy dialect.

#### Hive Interface

This [asynchronous API](https://github.com/cloudera/hue/tree/master/apps/beeswax) based on the Thrift API of Hive is very mature and powers an excellent integration of Apache Hive and Apache Impala.

#### Custom

If the built-in HiveServer2 (Hive, Impala, Spark SQL), SqlAlchemy (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, Presto...) don’t meet your needs, you can implement your own connector to the notebook app:

* List of [all connectors](https://github.com/cloudera/hue/tree/master/desktop/libs/notebook/src/notebook/connectors)
* Each connector API subclasses the [Base API](https://github.com/cloudera/hue/blob/master/desktop/libs/notebook/src/notebook/connectors/base.py) and must implement the methods defined within. Refer to the [JDBC](https://github.com/cloudera/hue/blob/master/desktop/libs/notebook/src/notebook/connectors/jdbc.py) or [RdbmsApi](https://github.com/cloudera/hue/blob/master/desktop/libs/notebook/src/notebook/connectors/rdbms.py) for representative examples

* [Kafka SQL](https://github.com/cloudera/hue/blob/master/desktop/libs/notebook/src/notebook/connectors/ksql.py)
* [Solr SQL](https://github.com/cloudera/hue/blob/master/desktop/libs/notebook/src/notebook/connectors/solr.py)
* [JDBC](https://github.com/cloudera/hue/blob/master/desktop/libs/notebook/src/notebook/connectors/jdbc.py)

The JDBC API relies on a small JDBC proxy running next to the Hue API. By default it won't be built without setting the `BUILD_DB_PROXY` flag, e.g.:

    export BUILD_DB_PROXY=true make install

**Note** In the long term, SqlAlchemy is prefered as more "Python native".

#### Potential connectors

It is recommended to develop an SqlAlchemy connector if yours is not already [existing](/administrator/configuration/connectors/#databases).

### Catalogs

The backends is pluggable by providing alternative [client interfaces](https://github.com/cloudera/hue/tree/master/desktop/libs/metadata/src/metadata/catalog):

* [Apache Atlas](https://atlas.apache.org/)
* Cloudera Navigator
* Dummy (skeleton for integrating new catalogs)

#### Apache Atlas

* [Client API](https://github.com/cloudera/hue/tree/master/desktop/libs/metadata/src/metadata/catalog/atlas_client.py)

#### Potential connectors

* [Linkedin DataHub](https://github.com/linkedin/datahub)

### Storages

Various storage systems can be interacted with. The [`fsmanager.py`](https://github.com/cloudera/hue/blob/master/desktop/core/src/desktop/lib/fsmanager.py) is the main router to each API.

**Note** Apache Ozone as well as Ceph can be used via the S3 browser.

#### Hadoop HDFS

* [WebHdfs API](https://github.com/cloudera/hue/blob/master/desktop/libs/hadoop/src/hadoop/fs/webhdfs.py)

#### AWS S3

* [S3 API](https://github.com/cloudera/hue/blob/master/desktop/libs/aws/src/aws/s3)

#### Azure ADLS

* [ADLS v1](https://github.com/cloudera/hue/blob/master/desktop/libs/azure/src/azure/adls)

#### HBase / Key Value Stores

With just a few changes in the [Python API](https://github.com/cloudera/hue/blob/master/apps/hbase/src/hbase/api.py), the HBase browser could be compatible with Apache Kudu or Google Big Table.

#### Potential connectors

* Google Cloud Storage is currently a work in progress with [HUE-8978](https://issues.cloudera.org/browse/HUE-8978)

### Jobs

#### Apache Spark / Livy

Based on the [Livy REST API](/administrator/configuration/connectors/#apache-spark).
