This section goes into greater detail on how to build and reuse the components of Hue.


## Building

### Dependencies

* The OS specific install instructions are listed in the [install guide]({{% param baseURL %}}administrator/installation/dependencies/)
* Python 2.7+ (Python 3 support tracked in [HUE-8737](https://issues.cloudera.org/browse/HUE-8737))
* Django (1.11 already included in the distribution)
* Java (Java 1.8) (should go away after [HUE-8740](https://issues.cloudera.org/browse/HUE-8740))
* npm (6.4+)
* [Mako](http://www.makotemplates.org/) is the templating language
* [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/)
* [Knockout js](http://knockoutjs.com/)

### Quick Start

Build once:

    make apps

Then start the dev server (which will auto reload):

    ./build/env/bin/hue runserver

If you are changing Javascript or CSS files, also start:

    npm run dev

Then it is recommended to use MySQL or PostGres as the [database](({{% param baseURL %}}).

Open the `hue.ini` file in a text editor. Directly below the
`[[database]]` line, add the following options (and modify accordingly for
your MySQL setup):

    host=localhost
    port=3306
    engine=mysql
    user=hue
    password=secretpassword
    name=hue

### Javascript

The javascript files are currently being migrated to webpack bundles, during this process some files will live under src/desktop/static/ and some will live under src/dekstop/js

For changes to the files under src/desktop/js the following applies:

First make sure all third-party dependencies defined in package.json are installed into node_modules/

    npm install

Also run this after making changes to package.json, adding new third-party dependencies etc.

To generate the js bundles run:

    npm run webpack
    npm run webpack-workers
    npm run webpack-login

During development the bundles can be autogenerated when it detects changes to the .js files, for this run:

    npm run dev

Before sending a review with changes to the bundles run:

    npm run lint-fix

and possibly fix any issues it might report.

### Documentation

Install [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/).

Develop:

    hugo serve

Build the doc website:

    hugo

Release:

    scp -r docs/docs-site/public/* root@docs.gethue.com:/var/www/docs.gethue.com


### CSS / LESS

After changing the CSS in a .less file, rebuilding with:

    make css

### SQL Autocomplete

Install a patched jison:

    git clone https://github.com/JohanAhlen/jison
    cd jison
    npm install -g .

Then run:

    make sql-all-parsers

### Ace Editor

After modifying files under tools/ace-editor run the following to build ace.js

    npm install
    make ace

### Internationalization

How to update all the messages and compile them:

    make locales

How to update and compile the messages of one app:

    cd apps/beeswax
    make compile-locale

How to create a new locale for an app:

    cd $APP_ROOT/src/$APP_NAME/locale
    $HUE_ROOT/build/env/bin/pybabel init -D django -i en_US.pot -d . -l fr

## API Server

### From 30,000 feet

![From up on high]({{% param baseURL %}}images/from30kfeet.png)

Hue, as a "container" web application, sits in between your Hadoop installation
and the browser.  It hosts all the Hue Apps, including the built-in ones, and
ones that you may write yourself.

### The Hue Server

![Web Back-end]({{% param baseURL %}}images/webbackend.png)

Hue is a web application built on the Django python web framework.
Django, running on the WSGI container/web server (typically CherryPy), manages
the url dispatch, executes application logic code, and puts together the views
from their templates.  Django uses a database (typically sqlite)
to manage session data, and Hue applications can use it as well
for their "models".  (For example, the saved Editor stores
saved queries in the database.)

In addition to the web server, some Hue applications run
daemon processes "on the side". Some examples are the `Celery Task Server`, `Celery Beat`.

### Interacting with external services

![Interacting with Hadoop]({{% param baseURL %}}images/interactingwithhadoop.png)

Hue provides some APIs for interacting with external services like Databases of File storages.
These APIs work by making REST API or Thrift calls
the Hadoop daemons.

### An Architectural View

![Architecture]({{% param baseURL %}}images/architecture.png)

A Hue application may span three tiers: (1) the UI
and user interaction in the client's browser, (2) the
core application logic in the Hue web
server, and (3) external services with which applications
may interact.

The absolute minimum that you must implement (besides
boilerplate), is a
"Django [view](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/#the-view-layer/)"
function that processes the request and the associated template
to render the response into HTML.

Many apps will evolve to have a bit of custom JavaScript and
CSS styles. Apps that need to talk to an external service
will pull in the code necessary to talk to that service.

### File Layout

The Hue "framework" is in ``desktop/core/`` and contains the Web components.
``desktop/libs/`` is the API for talking to various Hadoop services.
The installable apps live in ``apps/``.  Please place third-party dependencies in the app's ext-py/
directory.

The typical directory structure for inside an application includes:
```
  src/
    for Python/Django code
      models.py
      urls.py
      views.py
      forms.py
      settings.py

  conf/
    for configuration (``.ini``) files to be installed

  static/
    for static HTML/js resources and help doc

  templates/
    for data to be put through a template engine

  locales/
    for localizations in multiple languages
```

For the URLs within your application, you should make your own ``urls.py``
which will be automatically rooted at ``/yourappname/`` in the global
namespace. See ``apps/about/src/about/urls.py`` for an example.

### Configurations

#### File

Hue uses a typed configuration system that reads configuration files (in an
ini-style format).  By default, Hue loads all `*.ini` files in the `build/desktop/conf`
directory.  The configuration files have the following format:

    # This is a comment
    [ app_name ]          # Same as your app's name
    app_property = "Pink Floyd"

    [[ section_a ]]         # The double brackets start a section under [ app_name ]
    a_weight = 80         # that is useful for grouping
    a_height = 180

    [[ filesystems ]]       # Sections are also useful for making a list
    [[[ cluster_1 ]]]       # All list members are sub-sections of the same type
    namenode_host = localhost
    # User may define more:
    # [[[ cluster_2 ]]]
    # namenode_host = 10.0.0.1


#### Variables

Your application's `conf.py` is special. It provides access to the configuration file (and even
default configurations not specified in the file). Using the above example, your `conf.py` should
define the following:

A `desktop.lib.conf.Config` object for `app_property`, such as:

    MY_PROPERTY = Config(key='app_property', default='Beatles', help='blah')

  You can access its value by `MY_PROPERTY.get()`.

A `desktop.lib.conf.ConfigSection` object for `section_a`, such as:

    SECTION_A = ConfigSection(key='section_a',
          help='blah',
          members=dict(
            AWEIGHT=Config(key='a_weight', type=int, default=0),
            AHEIGHT=Config(key='a_height', type=int, default=0)))

  You can access the values by `SECTION_A.AWEIGHT.get()`.

A `desktop.lib.conf.UnspecifiedConfigSection` object for `filesystems`, such as:

    FS = UnspecifiedConfigSection(
        key='filesystems',
        each=ConfigSection(members=dict(
            nn_host=Config(key='namenode_host', required=True))

An `UnspecifiedConfigSection` is useful when the children of the section are not known.
When Hue loads your application's configuration, it binds all sub-sections. You can
access the values by:

    cluster1_val = FS['cluster_1'].nn_host.get()
    all_clusters = FS.keys()
    for cluster in all_clusters:
        val = FS[cluster].nn_host.get()


Application can automatically detect configuration problems and alert
the admin. To take advantage of this feature, create a `config_validator`
function in your `conf.py`:

    def config_validator(user):
      """
      config_validator(user) -> [(config_variable, error_msg)] or None
      Called by core check_config() view.
      """
      res = [ ]
      if not REQUIRED_PROPERTY.get():
        res.append((REQUIRED_PROPERTY, "This variable must be set"))
      if MY_INT_PROPERTY.get() < 0:
        res.append((MY_INT_PROPERTY, "This must be a non-negative number"))
      return res


<div class="note">
  You should specify the <code>help="..."</code> argument to all configuration
  related objects in your <code>conf.py</code>. The examples omit some for the
  sake of space. But you and your application's users can view all the
  configuration variables by doing:
  <pre>
    $ build/env/bin/hue config_help
  </pre>
</div>


### Saving documents

Each app used to have its own model to store its data (e.g. a saving a SQL query, query history...). All the models have been unified into a single Document2 model in the desktop app:

``desktop/core/src/desktop/models.py``.

The `Document2` model provides automatically creation, sharing and saving. It persists the document data into a json field, which limits the need ot database migrations and simplifies the interaction with the frontend.

`Document2` is based on [Django Models](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/#the-model-layer)
are Django's Object-Relational Mapping framework.


### Walk-through of a Django View

![Django Request]({{% param baseURL %}}images/django_request.png)


Django is an MVC framework, except that the controller is called a
"[view](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/#the-view-layer)" and
the "view" is called a "template".  For an application developer, the essential
flow to understand is how the "urls.py" file provides a mapping between URLs (expressed as a
regular expression, optionally with captured parameters) and view functions.
These view functions typically use their arguments (for example, the captured parameters) and
their request object (which has, for example, the POST and GET parameters) to
prepare dynamic content to be rendered using a template.

### Templates: Django and Mako

In Hue, the typical pattern for rendering data through a template
is:

    from desktop.lib.django_util import render

    def view_function(request):
      return render('view_function.mako', request, dict(greeting="hello"))

The `render()` function chooses a template engine (either Django or Mako) based on the
extension of the template file (".html" or ".mako"). Mako templates are more powerful,
in that they allow you to run arbitrary code blocks quite easily, and are more strict (some
would say finicky); Django templates are simpler, but are less expressive.


### Authentication Backends

Hue exposes a configuration flag ("auth") to configure
a custom authentication backend.
See http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/auth/#writing-an-authentication-backend
for writing such a backend.

In addition to that, backends may support a `manages_passwords_externally()` method, returning
True or False, to tell the user manager application whether or not changing
passwords within Hue is possible.

### Authorization

Applications may define permission sets for different actions. Administrators
can assign permissions to user groups in the UserAdmin application. To define
custom permission sets, modify your app's `settings.py` to create a list of
`(identifier, description)` tuples:

    PERMISSION_ACTIONS = [
      ("delete", "Delete really important data"),
      ("email", "Send email to the entire company"),
      ("identifier", "Description of the permission")
    ]

Then you can use this decorator on your view functions to enforce permission:

    @desktop.decorators.hue_permission_required("delete", "my_app_name")
    def delete_financial_report(request):
      ...

### Using and Installing Thrift

Right now, we check in the generated thrift code.
To generate the code, you'll need the thrift binary version 0.9.0.
Please download from http://thrift.apache.org/.

The modules using ``Thrift`` have some helper scripts like ``regenerate_thrift.sh``
for regenerating the code from the interfaces.

### Profiling

Hue has a profiling system built in, which can be used to analyze server-side
performance of applications.  To enable profiling:

    build/env/bin/hue runprofileserver

Then, access the page that you want to profile.  This will create files like
/tmp/useradmin.users.000072ms.2011-02-21T13:03:39.745851.prof.  The format for
the file names is /tmp/<app_module>.<page_url>.<time_taken>.<timestamp>.prof.

Hue uses the hotshot profiling library for instrumentation.  The documentation
for this library is located at: http://docs.python.org/library/hotshot.html.

You can use kcachegrind to view the profiled data graphically:

    hotshot2calltree /tmp/xyz.prof > /tmp/xyz.trace
    kcachegrind /tmp/xyz.trace

More generally, you can programmatically inspect a trace:

    #!/usr/bin/python
    import hotshot.stats
    import sys

    stats = hotshot.stats.load(sys.argv[1])
    stats.sort_stats('cumulative', 'calls')
    stats.print_stats(100)

This script takes in a .prof file, and orders function calls by the cumulative
time spent in that function, followed by the number of times the function was
called, and then prints out the top 100 time-wasters.  For information on the
other stats available, take a look at this website:
http://docs.python.org/library/profile.html#pstats.Stats


### Upgrades

After upgrading the version of Hue, running these two commands will make sure the
database has the correct tables and fields.

    ./build/env/bin/hue syncdb
    ./build/env/bin/hue migrate


### Debugging Tips and Tricks

* Set `DESKTOP_DEBUG=1` as an environment variable if you want logs to go to stderr
  as well as to the respective log files.
* Use runserver.  If you want to set a CLI breakpoint, just insert
  `__import__("ipdb").set_trace()`
  into your code.
* Django tends to restart its server whenever it notices a file changes.  For
  certain things (like configuration changes), this is not sufficient.  Restart
  the server whole-heartedly.
* We recommend developing with the Chrome console.


## Web interface

Developing applications for Hue requires a minimal amount of CSS
(and potentially JavaScript) to use existing functionality.

In a nutshell, front-end development in Hue is using
[Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) and
[Knockout js](http://knockoutjs.com/) to layout your app and script the custom
interactions.

### Node.js

During development the bundles can be autogenerated when it detects changes to the .js files, for this run:

    npm run dev

### CSS Styles

Hue uses [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) version 2.0 CSS
styles and layouts. They are highly reusable and flexible. Your app doesn't
have to use these styles, but if you do, it'll save you some time and make your
app look at home in Hue.

On top of the standard Bootstrap styles, Hue defines a small set of custom
styles in *desktop/core/static/css/jhue.css*.

### Defining Styles

When you create your application it will provision a CSS file for you in the
*static/css* directory. For organization purposes, your styles should go here
(and any images you have should go in *static/art*). Your app's name will be a
class that is assigned to the root of your app in the DOM. So if you created an
app called "calculator" then every window you create for your app will have the
class "calculator".  Every style you define should be prefixed with this to
prevent you from accidentally colliding with the framework style. Examples:

    /* the right way: */
    .calculator p {
      /* all my paragraphs should have a margin of 8px */
      margin: 8px;
      /* and a background from my art directory */
      background: url(../art/paragraph.gif);
    }
    /* the wrong way: */
    p {
      /* woops; we're styling all the paragraphs on the page, affecting
         the common header! */
      margin: 8px;
      background: url(../art/paragraph.gif);
    }

### Icons

You should create an icon for your application that is a transparent png sized
24px by 24px. Your `settings.py` file should point to your icon via the `ICON`
variable. The `create_desktop_app` command creates a default icon for you.

<div class="note">
  If you do not define an application icon, your application will not show up
  in the navigation bar.
</div>

Hue ships with Twitter Bootstrap and Font Awesome 3 (http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/)
so you have plenty of scalable icons to choose from. You can style your elements to use them
like this (in your mako template):

    <!-- show a trash icon in a link -->
    <a href="#something"><i class="icon-trash"></i> Trash</a>

### Static files

For better performances, Hue uses the Django staticfiles app. If in production mode, if you edit
some static files, you would need to run this command or `make apps`. No actions are needed in
development mode.
```
./build/env/bin/hue collectstatic
```

## Testing

### The short story

Install the mini cluster (only once):

    ./tools/jenkins/jenkins.sh slow

Run all the tests:

    build/env/bin/hue test all

Or just some parts of the tests, e.g.:

    build/env/bin/hue test specific impala
    build/env/bin/hue test specific impala.tests:TestMockedImpala
    build/env/bin/hue test specific impala.tests:TestMockedImpala.test_basic_flow

Jasmine tests:

    npm run test


### Longer story

The ``test`` management command prepares the arguments (test app names)
and passes them to nose (django_nose.nose_runner). Nose will then magically
find all the tests to run.

Tests themselves should be named *_test.py.  These will be found
as long as they're in packages covered by django.  You can use the
unittest frameworks, or you can just name your method with
the word "test" at a word boundary, and nose will find it.
See apps/hello/src/hello/hello_test.py for an example.


#### Helpful command-line tricks

To run tests that do not depend on Hadoop, use:

    build/env/bin/hue test fast

To run all tests, use:

    build/env/bin/hue test all

To run only tests of a particular app, use:

    build/env/bin/hue test specific <app>

E.g.
  build/env/bin/hue test specific filebrowser

To run a specific test, use:

    build/env/bin/hue test specific <test_func>

E.g.
  build/env/bin/hue test specific useradmin.tests:test_user_admin

Start up pdb on test failures:

    build/env/bin/hue test <args> --pdb --pdb-failure -s

Point to an Impalad and trigger the Impala tests:

    build/env/bin/hue test impala impalad-01.gethue.com


#### Create and run the Jasmine tests

Add them in a "spec" subfolder relative to the file under test and the filename of the test has to end with "Spec.js".

    someFile.js              <- File under test
    ├── spec/
    │   ├── someFileSpec.js  <- File containing tests

Run all the tests once with:

    npm run test

Optionally to use Karma and headless chrome for the tests you can run

    npm run test-karma

See ```desktop/core/src/desktop/js/spec/karma.config.js``` for various options


#### Special environment variables

    DESKTOP_LOGLEVEL=<level>
      level can be DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, or CRITICAL

      When specified, the console logger is set to the given log level. A console
      logger is created if one is not defined.

    DESKTOP_DEBUG
      A shorthand for DESKTOP_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG. Also turns on output HTML
      validation.

    DESKTOP_PROFILE
      Turn on Python profiling. The profile data is saved in a file. See the
      console output for the location of the file.

    DESKTOP_LOG_DIR=$dir
      Specify the HUE log directory. Defaults to ./log.

    DESKTOP_DB_CONFIG=$db engine:db name:test db name:username:password:host:port
      Specify alternate DB connection parameters for HUE to use. Useful for
      testing your changes against, for example, MySQL instead of sqlite. String
      is a colon-delimited list.

    TEST_IMPALAD_HOST=impalad-01.gethue.com
      Point to an Impalad and trigger the Impala tests.


#### Writing tests that depend on Hadoop

Use pseudo_hdfs4.py!  You should tag such tests with "requires_hadoop", as follows:

    from nose.plugins.attrib import attr

    @attr('requires_hadoop')
    def your_test():
      ...


#### Jenkins Configuration

Because building Hadoop (for the tests that require it) is slow, we've
separated the Jenkins builds into "fast" and "slow".  Both are run
via scripts/jenkins.sh, which should be kept updated with the latest
and greatest in build technologies.
