Hue service integration is generic and lets you integrate with other analytics systems. Here is a list of the main APIs:

* Connect or create SQL connectors to any database (Impala, MySQL, Presto...)
* List any files from any filesytem (HDFS, S3, ADLS...)
* List any job or query list (YARN, SQL queries, Kubernetes...)
* Integrate with a Data Catalog (Cloudera Navigator, Apache Atlas...)

In addition, whole new apps can also be created in order to provide end to end solutions.
