The [Entity-relationship model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity%E2%80%93relationship_model) (ERD) provides an illustration of various SQL entities, and the relationship between them. Entity types supported by the ERD diagram are currently `Table` & `Literal`. It has a very generic architecture, and more types of entities can be supported in the future.
