A recommended setup consists in:

* 2 Hues and 1 Load Balancer
* Databases: MySQL InnoDB, PostgreSQL, Oracle
* Authentication: [LDAP or Username/Password]({{% param baseURL %}}administrator/configuration/server/#authentication)

Typical setups range from 2 to 5 Hue servers, e.g. 3 Hue servers, 300+ unique users, peaks at 125 users/hour with 300 queries

In practice ~50 users / Hue peak time is the rule of thumb. This is accounting for the worse case scenarios and it will go much higher with the upcoming Task Server [HUE-8738](https://issues.cloudera.org/browse/HUE-8738) and Gunicorn [HUE-8739](https://issues.cloudera.org/browse/HUE-8739) integrations. Most of the scale issues are actually related to resource intensive operations like large download of query results or when an RPC call from Hue to a service is slow (e.g. submitting a query hangs when Hive is slow), not by the number of users.

Hue comes with caching of SQL metadata throughout all the application, meaning the list of tables or a database or the column description of a table are only fetched once and re-used in the autocomplete, table browser, left and right panels etc.. The profiling of calls adds in the logs with a total time taken by each request automatically logged.

e.g.

    [24/Jul/2019 14:17:32 +0000] resource     DEBUG    GET /jobs Got response in 151ms: {"total":0,"offset":1,"len":1,"coordinatorjobs":[]}
    [24/Jul/2019 14:17:32 +0000] access       INFO     127.0.0.1 romain - "POST /jobbrowser/api/jobs HTTP/1.1" returned in 157ms (mem: 164mb)

## General Performance

* Hue must be behing a load balancer proxying static files. In Cloudera Manager Hue ships with HTTPD.
* Adding more Hue instances behind the load balancer will increase performances by 50 concurrent users.
* Database backend should be such as MySql/Postgres/Oracle. Hue does not work on SQLite as it makes concurrent calls to the database.
* Check the number of documents in the Hue database. If they are too many (more than 100 000), delete the old records:
  Stop the Hue service. Log on to the host of your Hue server. Go to Hue directory and run following clean up [command]({{% param baseURL %}}administrator/administration/operations/#commands):
<pre>
    cd /opt/cloudera/parcels/CDH/lib/hue # Hue home directory
    ./build/env/bin/hue desktop_document_cleanup
</pre>

* There are some memory fragmentation issues in Python that manifest in Hue. Check the memory usage of Hue periodically. Browsing HDFS dir with many files, downloading a query result, copying a HDFS files are costly operations memory wise.

The [Config Check]({{% param baseURL %}}administrator/administration/reference/) page of Hue (`/hue/about/`) in the administrator section will warn about detected risks. Make sure it is at zero.


## Query Editor Performance

* Compare performance of the Hive Query Editor in Hue with the exact same query in a beeline shell against the exact same HiveServer2 instance that Hue is pointing to. This will determine if Hue needs to be investigated or HiveServer2 needs to be investigated.
* Check the logging configuration for HiveServer2 by going to Hive service Configuration in Cloudera Manager. Search for HiveServer2 Logging Threshold and make sure that it is not set to DEBUG or TRACE. If it is, drop the logging level to INFO at a minimum.
* Configure individual dedicated HiveServer2 instances for each Hue instance separate from HiveServer2 instances used by other 3rd party tools or clients, or configure Hue to point to multiple HS2 instances behind a Load Balancer.
* Tune the query timeouts for HiveServer2 (in hive-site.xml) and Impala on the hue_safety_valve or hue.ini: Query Life Cycle
Downloading queries past a few thousands rows will lag and increase CPU/memory usage in Hue by a lot. It is for this we are truncating the results until further improvements.

## Load Balancers

Hue is often run with:

* Cherrypy with [NGINX](http://gethue.com/using-nginx-to-speed-up-hue-3-8-0/) (recommended)
* Cherrypy with HTTPD (built-in when using Cloudera Manager) (recommended)
* Gunicorn is coming with [HUE-8739](https://issues.cloudera.org/browse/HUE-8739)
* [Apache mod Python](http://gethue.com/how-to-run-hue-with-the-apache-server/)

## Hive and Impala queries life cycle

But what happens to the query results? How long are they kept? Why do they disappear sometimes? Why are some Impala queries are still “in flight” even if they are completed?   Each query is using some resources in Impala or HiveServer2. When the users submit a lot of queries, they are going to add up and crash the servers if nothing is done. Here are the latest settings that you can tweak:

### Impala

Hue tries to close the query when the user navigates away from the result page (as queries are generally fast, it is ok to close them quick). However, if the user never comes back checking the result of the query or never close the page, the query is going to stay. Impala is going to automatically expire the queries idle for than 10 minutes with the query_timeout_s property.

    [impala]
    # If > 0, the query will be timed out (i.e. cancelled) if Impala does not do any work
    # (compute or send back results) for that query within QUERY_TIMEOUT_S seconds.
    query_timeout_s=600

    # If > 0, the session will be timed out (i.e. cancelled) if Impala does not do any work
    # (compute or send back results) for that session within QUERY_TIMEOUT_S seconds (default 1 hour).
    session_timeout_s=3600

Until this version, the only alternative workaround to close all the queries, is to restart Hue (or Impala).

Note: Impala currently only cancels the query but does not close it. It will be improved in a future version with IMPALA-1575. In the meantime specify a -idle_session_timeout=20 in the Impala flags (“Command Line Argument Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve)”). This setting is also available in the Hue configuration.

### Hive

Hue never closes the Hive queries by default (as some queries can take hours of processing time). Also if your query volume is low (e.g. < a few hundreds a day) and you restart HiveServer2 every week, you are probably not affected. To get the same behavior as Impala (and close the query when the user leaves the page), switch on in the hue.ini:

    [beeswax]
    # Hue will try to close the Hive query when the user leaves the editor page.
    # This will free all the query resources in HiveServer2, but also make its results inaccessible.
    close_queries=true

Some close_query and close_session commands were added:

    build/env/bin/hue close_queries --help

    Usage: build/env/bin/hue close_queries [options] <age_in_days>  (default is 7)

    Closes the non running queries older than 7 days. If <all> is specified, close the ones of any types.

To run, be sure to export these environment variables:

    export HUE_CONF_DIR="/var/run/cloudera-scm-agent/process/`ls -alrt /var/run/cloudera-scm-agent/process | grep HUE | tail -1 | awk '{print $9}'`"
    export HIVE_CONF_DIR="/var/run/cloudera-scm-agent/process/`ls -alrt /var/run/cloudera-scm-agent/process | grep HUE | tail -1 | awk '{print $9}'`/hive-conf"

Then for example:

    ./build/env/bin/hue close_queries 0
    Closing (all=False) HiveServer2 queries older than 0 days...
    1 queries closed.

    ./build/env/bin/hue close_sessions 0 hive
    Closing (all=False) HiveServer2 sessions older than 0 days...
    1 sessions closed.

You can then add this commands into a crontab and expire the queries older than N days.

Like Impala, HiveServer2 can now automatically expires queries. So tweak hive-site.xml with:

    <property>
      <name>hive.server2.session.check.interval</name>
      <value>3000</value>
      <description>The check interval for session/operation timeout, which can be disabled by setting to zero or negative value.</description>
    </property>

    <property>
      <name>hive.server2.idle.session.timeout</name>
      <value>3000</value>
      <description>Session will be closed when it's not accessed for this duration, which can be disabled by setting to zero or negative value.</description>
    </property>

    <property>
      <name>hive.server2.idle.operation.timeout</name>
      <value>0</value>
      <description>Operation will be closed when it's not accessed for this duration of time, which can be disabled by setting to zero value. With positive value, it's checked for operations in terminal state only (FINISHED, CANCELED, CLOSED, ERROR). With negative value, it's checked for all of the operations regardless of state</description>
    </property>

**Note**

This is the recommended solution for Hive. User wishing to keep some result for longer can issue a CREATE TABLE AS SELECT … or export the results in Hue.

## Monitoring

Performing a `GET /desktop/debug/is_alive` will return a 200 response if running.

## Behind a Proxy

A Web proxy lets you centralize all the access to a certain URL and prettify the address e.g.

    ec2-54-247-321-151.compute-1.amazonaws.com --> demo.gethue.com

Here is one way to do it with [NGINX](http://gethue.com/using-nginx-to-speed-up-hue-3-8-0/) or [Apache](http://gethue.com/i-put-a-proxy-on-hue/).

## Task Server

** Not supported yet**

The task server is currently a work in progress to outsource all the blocking or resource intensive operations
outside of the API server. Follow [HUE-8738](https://issues.cloudera.org/browse/HUE-8738) for more information
on when first usable task will be released.

Until then, here is how to try the task server service.

Make sure you have Redis installed and running.

    sudo apt-get install redis-server -y

In hue.ini, telling the API server that the Task Server is available:

    [desktop]
    [[task_server]]
    enabled=true

Starting the Task server:

    ./build/env/bin/celery worker -l info -A desktop

### Tasks

#### Query Task

When the task server is enabled, SQL queries are going to be submitted outside of the Hue servers.

To configure the storage to use to persist those, edit the `result_file_storage` setting:

    [desktop]
    [[task_server]]
    result_file_storage='{"backend": "django.core.files.storage.FileSystemStorage", "properties": {"location": "/var/lib/hue/query-results"}}'

#### Email Task

#### Task Scheduler

For schedules configured statically in Python:

    ./build/env/bin/celery -A desktop beat -l info

For schedules configured dynamically via a table with Django Celery Beat:

    [desktop]
    [[task_server]]
    beat_enabled=true

Then:

    ./build/env/bin/celery -A desktop beat -l info --scheduler django_celery_beat.schedulers:DatabaseScheduler

Note: the first time the tables need to be created with:

    ./build/env/bin/hue migrate

### Flower

Web UI to monitor tasks:

    ./build/env/bin/pip install flower
    ./build/env/bin/celery flower --broker=redis://localhost:6379/0

Then open-up [http://localhost:5555/tasks](http://localhost:5555/tasks)
