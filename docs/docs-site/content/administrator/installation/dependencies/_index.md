## Python

Hue employs some Python modules which use native code and requires certain development libraries be installed on your system. To install from the tarball, you'll need these library development packages and tools installed on your system:

Versions supported:
* Python 2.7
* Python 3.5+ (can be tested cf. instructions on [HUE-8737](https://issues.cloudera.org/browse/HUE-8737))
```
# If you are using Python 3.5+, set PYTHON_VER before the build, like
export PYTHON_VER=python3.8
```

## Database

Hue is being ran the most with [MySQL InnoDB, PostgreSQL or Oracle](https://docs.cloudera.com/documentation/enterprise/latest/topics/hue_dbs_0.html).

### MySQL / MariaDB

The client lib [MySQL-python](https://github.com/cloudera/hue/tree/master/desktop/core/ext-py/MySQL-python-1.2.5) is already included so it should work out of the box.

With the recent OSs like Ubuntu 20.04 or using Python 3, the MySQL-python lib won't compile properly and will produce an error similar to:

    _mysql.c: Cannot open include file my_config.h

The lib folder needs to be swapped with https://pypi.org/project/mysqlclient/. Unfortunately for licensing reason (GPL vs Apache) this can't be officially done in the Hue repository.

Read [HUE-9390](https://issues.cloudera.org/browse/HUE-9390) for more details and the two commits doing this change.

### PostgreSQL

You would need the OS `python-psycopg2` or Python [psycopg2](https://pypi.org/project/psycopg2/).

### Oracle

How to install the client lib.

#### Version 11

Download both instantclient-basic and instantclient-sdk of the same version (11.2.0.4.0 for this example) and on your ~/.bash_profile, add

    export ORACLE_HOME=/usr/local/share/oracle
    export VERSION=11.2.0.4.0
    export ARCH=x86_64
    export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=$ORACLE_HOME
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$ORACLE_HOME

and then

    source ~/.bash_profile
    sudo mkdir -p $ORACLE_HOME
    sudo chmod 775 $ORACLE_HOME

then unzip the content of both downloaded zip files into the newly created $ORACLE_HOME in a way that the 'sdk' folder is at the same level with the other files and then

    ln -s libclntsh.dylib.11.1 libclntsh.dylib
    ln -s libocci.dylib.11.1 libocci.dylib

and finally

    cd sdk
    unzip ottclasses.zip

#### Version 12

Hue comes with an older Oracle client cx_Oracle-5.2.1 Python module so it will fail. We need to do the above client install and then upgrade Hue's client module to at least cx_Oracle-5.3.

Make sure you have the `python-dev` package dependencies, ensure that ORACLE_HOME and LB_LIBRARY_PATH are properly set so that pip knows which version to install, then:

    echo $ORACLE_HOME $LD_LIBRARY_PATH

    ./build/env/bin/pip install cx_Oracle

Tip: You can also wget the proper cx_Oracle file yourself: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/cx_Oracle/.

Tip: Going to where is the Oracle client, e.g. /usr/local/share/oracle then creating a symlink similar to below could even trick the cx_Oracle-5.2.1 module to work with 12.2 without doing the pip upgrade:

    ln -s libclntsh.so.12.2 libclntsh.so.11.1

There is more details on this [Apply Temporary Workaround for Oracle 12 Client](https://docs.cloudera.com/documentation/enterprise/latest/topics/hue_dbs_oracle_pkg.html#concept_qx3_hfw_4z).

Installing Python 2.7:

### CentOS 6.8 / 6.9 OS

Check your OS Version:

    cat /etc/redhat-release

Make sure "/etc/redhat-release" contains "CentOS 6.8 or 6.9" version. These instructions are tested on CentOS 6.8 and 6.9 versions only. It may or may not work on previous CentOS 6 series OS.

    yum install -y centos-release-SCL
