# Metrics - Prometheus / Graphana

Goal: understanding of where exactly the time is being spent when executing queries (e.g. in Hue database, in interpreter, RPC call to warehouse...)

* https://prometheus.io
* https://grafana.com/grafana/

# TODO

* Alerting: when is alive wrong more than X seconds
* Number of active users
* Resource usage: CPU, DB calls, memory, IOs
* Slowness: percentiles times of requests
* Number of queries

* Provide default Graphana dashboard & alerting
