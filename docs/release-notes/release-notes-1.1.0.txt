Hue v1.1.0, released Oct 11, 2010
=================================

Hue is a web interface for Hadoop, and a platform for building custom
applications with a rich framework. The 1.1.0 is a minor release, largely
focused on adding security support to Hue, matching the security
support of Cloudera's Distribution for Hadoop 3, beta 3.


Notable Changes and Caveats
---------------------------
Kerberos Integration for Secured Hadoop Clusters:

* Authenticated access to Hadoop File System
* Authenticated job submission

Frontend and SDK:

* Support for tree-view table, in which a row can be expanded to show its
children rows.
* Improvement to double-click handling.
* Improvement to meta-refresh handling.
* JFrame Filter to load content into a DIV via AJAX.
* JFrame Filter to update the active url in a JBrowser.

Documentation:

* Fixes to Help application to improve reliability.
* Updates to Beeswax, File Browser, Job Designer.

Caveats:

* Hue 1.1.0 only works with CDH3b3 or newer. CDH2 and earlier versions of CDH3
will not work.
* The default port for the namenode plugins has changed from 9090 to 10090.


Application Compatibility
-------------------------
The core Hadoop communication layer (to HDFS and JobTracker) now has support
for passing security credentials. A few low level APIs have changed, but most
applications should not be affected.
