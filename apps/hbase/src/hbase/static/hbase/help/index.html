<h1>HBase Browser</h1>
<p>We'll take a look at the new <a href="http://gethue.tumblr.com/post/59071544309/the-web-ui-for-hbase-hbase-browser">HBase Browser App</a>
added in Hue 2.5 and improved significantly since.</p>

<iframe frameborder="0" height="495" src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/72357888" width="900"></iframe>

<p>Prerequisites before using the app:</p>
<p>1. Have HBase and Thrift Service 1 initiated (Thrift can be configured)</p>
<p>2. Configure your list of HBase Clusters in
<a href="https://github.com/cloudera/hue/blob/master/desktop/conf.dist/hue.ini#L467">hue.ini</a>
to point to your Thrift IP/Port</p>
<h2>SmartView</h2>
<p>The smartview is the view that you land on when you first enter a table.
On the left hand side are the row keys and hovering over a row reveals a
list of controls on the right. Click a row to select it, and once
selected you can perform batch operations, sort columns, or do any
amount of standard database operations. To explore a row, simple scroll
to the right. By scrolling, the row should continue to lazily-load cells
until the end.</p>
<h3>Adding Data</h3>
<p>To initially populate the table, you can insert a new row or bulk upload
CSV/TSV/etc. type data into your table.</p>
<p>On the right hand side of a row is a '+' sign that lets you insert
columns into your
row</p>
<h3>Mutating Data</h3>
<p>To edit a cell, simply click to edit inline.</p>
<p>If you need more control or data about your cell, click â€œFull Editorâ€ to
edit.</p>
<p>In the full editor, you can view cell history or upload binary data to
the cell. Binary data of certain MIME Types are detected, meaning you
can view and edit images, PDFs, JSON, XML, and other types directly in
your browser!</p>
<p>Hovering over a cell also reveals some more controls (such as the delete
button or the timestamp). Click the title to select a few and do batch
operations:</p>

<h3>Smart Searchbar</h3>
<p>The "Smart Searchbar" is a sophisticated tool that helps you zero-in on
your data. The smart search supports a number of operations. The most
basic ones include finding and scanning row keys. Here I am selecting
two row keys with:</p>
<pre><code>domain.100, domain.200
</code></pre>
<p>Submitting this query gives me the two rows I was looking for. If I want
to fetch rows after one of these, I have to do a scan. This is as easy
as writing a '+' followed by the number of rows you want to fetch.</p>
<pre><code>domain.100, domain.200 +5
</code></pre>
<p>Fetches domain.100 and domain.200 followed by the next 5 rows. If you're
ever confused about your results, you can look down below and the query
bar and also click in to edit your query.</p>
<p>The Smart Search also supports column filtering. On any row, I can
specify the specific columns or families I want to retrieve. With:</p>
<pre><code>domain.100[column_family:]
</code></pre>
<p>I can select a bare family, or mix columns from different families like
so:</p>
<pre><code>domain.100[family1:, family2:, family3:column_a]
</code></pre>
<p>Doing this will restrict my results from one row key to the columns I
specified. If you want to restrict column families only, the same effect
can be achieved with the filters on the right. Just click to toggle a
filter.</p>
<p>Finally, let's try some more complex column filters. I can query for
bare columns:</p>
<pre><code>domain.100[column_a]
</code></pre>
<p>This will multiply my query over all column families. I can also do
prefixes and scans:</p>
<p>domain.100[family: prefix* +3]</p>
<p>This will fetch me all columns that start with prefix* limited to 3
results. Finally, I can filter on range:</p>
<pre><code>domain.100[family: column1 to column100]
</code></pre>
<p>This will fetch me all columns in 'family:' that are lexicographically
&gt;= column1 but &lt;= column100. The first column ('column1') must be a
valid column, but the second can just be any string for comparison.</p>
<p>The Smart Search also supports prefix filtering on rows. To select a
prefixed row, simply type the row key followed by a star *. The prefix
should be highlighted like any other searchbar keyword. A prefix scan is
performed exactly like a regular scan, but with a prefixed row.</p>
<pre><code>domain.10* +10
</code></pre>
<p>Finally, as a new feature, you can also take full advantage of the
<a href="denied:about:blank">HBase filtering</a>language, by typing your filter
string between curly braces. HBase Browser autocompletes your filters
for you so you don't have to look them up every time. You can apply
filters to rows or scans.</p>
<pre><code>domain.1000 {ColumnPrefixFilter('100-') AND ColumnCountGetFilter(3)}
</code></pre>
<p>This doc only covers a few basic features of the Smart Search. You can
take advantage of the full querying language by referring to the help
menu when using the app. These include column prefix, bare columns,
column range, etc. Remember that if you ever need help with the
searchbar, you can use the help menu that pops up while typing, which
will suggest next steps to complete your query.</p>
