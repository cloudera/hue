			<p>These buttons perform the standard nav actions of back, forward, and refresh. Note that the forward button doesn't do anything (unless you navigate somewhere else from here - say, by clicking the JFrame Gallery icon to go back to the index and then hitting back to come back to this page) as you don't have anything in your forward history. This button is not styled based on that state (i.e. it's not disabled because you cannot go forward). It's use is somewhat limited due to this.</p>
