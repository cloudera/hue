			<h1>Flash Messaging Testing.</h1>
			<p>You should see some messages on the desktop. They zoom away after about 2 seconds. These were set in the controller (views.py) using the following syntax:</p>
			<code><pre>request.flash.put('just a test')
request.flash.put('another growl test')
request.flash.put('yet another message to bubble up.')</pre></code>
