		<div class="jframe_padded">
			<p>Note that to use double click delegation on a container with links in it, if you don't want the links to fire on single click, you must add the css class "jframe_ignore" to them and configure the double click delegator to point to the desired link. This is especially useful with HtmlTables with selectable rows if you don't want a single click on the row to load another page, even if the user clicks on a link.</p>

				<a class="dblme jframe_ignore" href="/jframegallery/gallery/post-load.alert.popup.html">I show an alert if you double click anywhere inside the box around me. Note that I have the css class "jframe_ignore" which means a single click on me does nothing.</a>

				I'm a div with a double click delegate specified, but no link matching, so I don't do anything.
