I was pleasantly surprised! The store had a good amount of parking, and the store front was clean, open and had adequate seating around the perimeters. There were already 5-6 people sitting and waiting for their cars to be finished, and 2 people waiting infront of me to see a representative. All the guys working there were busy helping someone, yet were saying hello to us and reassuring they'd get to us very soon. I didn't wait an unneccesary amount of time and then was helped by Wally. He inspected my tires, recommended a plan of action gave me options, and we headed back into the store. After I made my decision to replace 2 of the tires, he checked their stock, and unfortunately they didn't have them there. BUT he called another store and had them picked up for the next morning, so I could just come back the next day to this same store and get those bad boys installed. Great! The prices were not as heafty (relief), and although there were a good amount of people the next day waiting for their cars to also be serviced, it took exactly the amount of time they'd told me (45 min). They apologized for the wait, but no need for that! The guy who helped me on the 2nd day (I'm sorry I forgot his name) was also very professional and great. I recommend this store and will be bringing my car here in the future most definitely. Thanks, guys!TIP: If you know you need to bring your car in, you can make an appointment with them online. They take walk-ins, but I believe it helps them manage their customers easier, and that in turn benefits you.","type":"business","useful":0,"user_id":"HLbhD2OyiMCUDRR4c1iXaw","name":"Discount Tire","full_address":"7920 W Bell Road Glendale, AZ 85308","latitude":33.63867,"longitude":-112.22953,"neighborhoods":"[]","open":"True","review_count":11,"state":"AZ","_version_":1461150196153974786},{"business_id":"1udzLbeQxmLTbOtgyVP0kQ","cool":0,"date":"2012-11-17","funny":0,"id":"YdrffsqmsOZX81hYvK8Qwg","stars":5,"text":"Delish & authentic!

WOW!  He makes teeth look real, not like Chiclets.  He does some fabulous cosmetic work!  I went in to have a crown put on and it was quick and painless. So quick that I didn't get to finish watching the movie!   Each chair has headphones and a flat screen that shows a movie (he keeps a good stock of the latest movies.).  Who'd have thought that going to the dentist would keep me so entertained?I've had to bring my son to each appointment as I haven't had anyone to keep him.  Does that matter? Nope.  Dr. Ito's office is equipped with a children's area in the back where the kids can watch a movie, read a book or play a game.

After sinking lots of his own time into tinkering with it and $1000 to the awful Meineke down the street, he gave up... until my car's transmission went for good, and he decided to fix the Bird (yeah!) so I could drive it (yes, I am super lucky!)Whitey's diagnosed it as the carburetor dumping fuel (which is what Meineke charged $500 to replace.. hmmm...). Upon hearing the story of Meineke, Whitey's told him to order the part himself to avoid the markup and they'd put it in for just labor.  Awesome!We took it home, but it wasn't running quite right still, and then failed emissions. Back to the shop it went.Whitey's took it back, spent ALL WEEKEND on it doing various minor things. At one point, they called and said 'We've done this, this and this, and it's still not quite right, so we're gonna keep it another day.'   I was glad they were admitting they actually felt it to be not right and were determined to fix it, versus just handing it back again... but I was dreading the repair bill.We picked it up Tuesday. The bill? $7. That's right - SEVEN DOLLARS. They only charged him for a spark plug and oil filter. That is amazing to me - I was expecting several hundred dollars for their time.  The car runs beautifully now, and they were extremely pleasant the entire time. I'm taking my alleged defunct car to them for a second opinion next week. I HIGHLY recommend Whitey's!","type":"business","useful":2,"user_id":"ysINNe8YpbOW_-5T5CSyhw","name":"Whitey's Auto Repair","full_address":"3014 N Civic Center Plz Scottsdale, AZ 85251","latitude":33.482227,"longitude":-111.92211,"neighborhoods":"[]","open":"True","review_count":23,"state":"AZ","_version_":1461150196286095364},{"business_id":"J-c25QK8xBqv1P-huUkoTQ","cool":0,"date":"2010-08-27","funny":0,"id":"nAJ0HvYhoUjo5wKMewK7iA","stars":5,"text":"I LOVE Laser for Less (Chandler)!  If you are going anywhere else for Laser hair removal you need to stop now and call to make an appointment with Laser for Less, Chandler.   I wasted a lot of $$$ at another Laser removal place before I found Laser for Less and now I am kicking myself for not going to them first.  If you pay to wax any part of your body you should be lasering that hair off.  It works better, lasts longer, and in the long run is cheaper.  Pros - 1. Free touch ups 14-18 days after your first appointment if they missed 1 hair they will touch up for free.  Never had a problem with them discouraging me, in fact it was the opposite they give me reminder cards so I know when my touch ups are due.  They encourage you to come in.2. They can also charge you by the laser shot instead of a whole area.  So if you only have a few random hairs they will just charge 10 cent per shot on the legs or 70 cents on the face or smaller areas.  You can't beat that deal.3. I am pretty sure they beat or match all prices in town.4. Once they laser the hair, all your hair will fall out and wont grow back for like 2 months, its better than waxing.  Not all laser removal places use the type of laser that does this place does.  That is why I recommend them, it works a lot better!5. They actually care about getting rid of unwanted hair and will go over all their policies with you.  Kristen is who I go to and she is great.  I have been to almost all their girls and they are good. 6. In fact when it was my birthday month I didn't know I got some discount and they back credited me for it, I feel like they are always trying to get me the best deal.  7. They always have deals.  Just last month they had their underarm extravaganza where you can get your underarms done for $30!!! That is so cheap.  They let you buy up to 3 sessions.  I referred a friend and she loved it so much because she didn't have to shave her underarms the WHOLE summer.  8. I love Laser for Less, CHANDLER!!!Cons - never having to shave again, darn.","type":"business","useful":3,"user_id":"mqueHx5CFC9IsZxLQb3H9g","name":"Laser For Less","full_address":"2855 W Ray Rd Ste 7 Chandler, AZ 85224","latitude":33.32031,"longitude":-111.89044,"neighborhoods":"[]","open":"True","review_count":9,"state":"AZ","_version_":1461150196296581123},{"business_id":"6sELDdbWi_Cjwp5uZ8PmGw","cool":8,"date":"2010-06-21","funny":10,"id":"ZucxvCvKaw7ViaKU00HYGg","stars":5,"text":"Ice Ice Baby...Ice Ice Baby...All right stop collaborate and listen;Ice Now is here and it's got my attention Make some drinks - not warm but frosty;And believe me when I say they are not costlyWill it ever melt? yo I don't know.Give them a call and they'll showTo the extreme I yelp like a sandal;Ice your drinks and get lit like a candle...

It goes to show you, you can please everyone. They are probably griping about something that their own fault...there are many people like that.In any case, my friend and I arrived at about 5:50 PM this past Sunday. It was pretty crowded, more than I thought for a Sunday evening and thought we would have to wait forever to get a seat but they said we'll be seated when the girl comes back from seating someone else. We were seated at 5:52 and the waiter came and got our drink orders. Everyone was very pleasant from the host that seated us to the waiter to the server. The prices were very good as well. We placed our orders once we decided what we wanted at 6:02. We shared the baked spaghetti calzone and the small 'Here's The Beef' pizza so we can both try them. The calzone was huge and we got the smallest one (personal) and got the small 11' pizza. Both were awesome! My friend liked the pizza better and I liked the calzone better. The calzone does have a sweetish sauce but that's how I like my sauce!We had to box part of the pizza to take it home and we were out the door by 6:42. So, everything was great and not like these bad reviewers. That goes to show you that  you have to try these things yourself because all these bad reviewers have some serious issues.","type":"business","useful":0,"user_id":"0a2KyEL0d3Yb1V6aivbIuQ","name":"Spinato's Pizzeria","full_address":"4848 E Chandler Blvd Phoenix, AZ 85044","latitude":33.305607,"longitude":-111.97876,"neighborhoods":"[]","open":"True","review_count":102,"state":"AZ","_version_":1461150196147683328},{"business_id":"6oRAC4uyJCsJl1X0WZpVSA","cool":0,"date":"2012-06-14","funny":0,"id":"IESLBzqUCLdSzSqm0eCSxQ","stars":4,"text":"love the gyro plate.

The menu was awesome.  I loved seeing all the variety: poblano peppers, mole, mahi mahi, mushrooms...something wrapped in banana leaves.  It made it difficult to choose something.  Here's what I've had so far: La Condesa Shrimp Burro and Baja Sur Dogfish Shark Taco.  They are both were very delicious meals but the shrimp burro stole the show.  So much flavor.  I snagged some bites from my hubbys mole and mahi mahi burros- mmmm such a delight.  The salsa bar is endless.  I really stocked up.  I was excited to try the strawberry salsa but it was too hot, in fact it all was, but I'm a big wimp when it comes to hot peppers. The horchata is handmade and delicious.  They throw pecans and some fruit in there too which is a yummy bonus!As if the good food wasn't enough to win me over the art in this restaurant sho did!
